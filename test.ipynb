Part a Customer Responsibility All customers, including government and non-government customers, are responsible for identifying the account types for their organization in compliance with their organizational policies. Customers will configure their account types in their existing Active Directory infrastructure or they will configure account types in AAD. Non-government customers will configure account types in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer account types via the Product1 Admin Center, see the following link: Guest access to Product3 meetings, if enabled, allows anyone with a meeting invite to access the meeting lobby; this method of guest access is considered session access as no account is assigned to the guest user. The meeting organizer is responsible for establishing the identity of lobby participants before granting them access to the meeting. Government customers are responsible for disabling guest access to Product3 meetings to remain compliant with FedRAMP standards as advised in \"Product1 Complementary Federal User Entity Control\". Non-government customers are responsible for determining if the use of guest access to Product3 meetings should be allowed for their organization. This setting can be configured by government and non-government customers. SharePoint Online guest invitations allow external users to access an organization\\'s SharePoint Online site(s). Government and non-government customers are responsible for determining if the use of guest access to SharePoint Online, as an account type, should be allowed for their organization. Government customers are responsible for disabling guest access to SharePoint Online to remain compliant with FedRAMP standards. The setting to allow or disallow guest access to SharePoint Online can be configured by government and non-government customers. For more information, see the Company Product1 Solution and Architecture Center: Product1 Product1 accounts are only provided to Company personnel supporting Product1 services. Accounts with permissions to internal assets and resources are not provisioned to customers. Company personnel are assigned unique corporate network (CorpNet) AD accounts as part of a standard onboarding to Company. These CorpNet accounts, known as user alias\\', do not have access to any production environment by default.For personnel supporting Product1 services, service team accounts are used to manage and administer Product1. Service team accounts tie to the user\\'s CorpNet account. This alias is consistent across all of the user\\'s accounts in all Company domains, including Product1. CorpNet and Product1 access are provisioned and managed using separate account management tools. Below are the different account types that Product1 utilizes: Standard Access All personnel with standard access to Product1 are granted system metadata read access used for regular troubleshooting, release management, and other maintenance and monitoring activities. Standard access provides permissions to key Product1 tools, services, SharePoint sites, documentation, and a variety of dashboards. Standard access does not provide access into the production environment. A user with standard access may have the need to review service-specific logs within Product1 to identify and diagnose issues. Any additional permissions above standard access requires elevation of access via Torus JIT, described below. Elevated Access All personnel must use JIT when interactive elevated access is required in the Product1 production environment. Except in the case of an approved exception as described below, there is no standing or persistent elevated access to the production environment. The primary exception is Break-Glass elevated access, described below. In scenarios where JIT does not yet support management of elevated access, standing access may exist; these gaps in JIT support are identified and tracked as an exception, which requires approval. Software deployment via automated means (i.e., not using an interactive login) does not require interactive login to a resource that is accessed via JIT. In this case, a service team member submits a job (e.g., Pull Request in Product2 DevOps), and another team member reviews, approves, and then the safe deployment system deploys. Elevated Access – Break-Glass Access Product1 maintains Break-Glass accounts with elevated access for use in the scenario that the JIT service is not available. These accounts have persistent elevated access to perform maintenance activities if JIT is unable to provide temporary elevated access. These accounts are carefully managed, only to be used in emergencies, and have notifications associated with their use. Whenever such an account is utilized, a Severity 2 incident ticket is generated that requires the service that owns the resource to investigate and determine whether the access is valid. Service Accounts Non-user, non-interactive service accounts are used to run relevant services. Service accounts are not used for interactive logins. For example, software deployment via automatedmeans does not require interactive login to a resource that would normally be accessed via JIT. In this example, a service team member submits a job, such as a Pull Request in Product2 DevOps, and another team member reviews and approves. Part b Customer Responsibility All customers, including government and non-government customers, are responsible for assigning account managers for the account types identified in part a of this control. Product1 Product1 assigns account managers to each role type using IDM, which include workflows that enforce business rules. Throughout this SSP, these tools are collectively referenced as \"account management tools\". Part c Customer Responsibility All customers, including government and non-government customers, are responsible for establishing conditions for group/role membership for their organization in compliance with their organizational policies. Non-government customers will configure groups in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer groups/roles in AAD via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Service teams establish conditions for group/role membership by defining and enforcing conditions for each group/role in account management tools. In addition, service teams use Torus and IDM to enforce additional, more granular conditions for privilege escalation and approval for interactive sessions. Product1 establishes conditions for group and role membership based on least privilege necessary for a user to perform their assigned duties. Predetermined conditions are established when groups are created. Part d Customer ResponsibilityPart 1, 2, 3 Government and non-government customers are responsible for identifying organizationally authorized users and specifying access privileges for those users using their existing Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. These users utilize the customer AD infrastructure to identify, authenticate, and'), Document(metadata={'id': 1}, page_content=\"apply permissions to that user's session. Customers communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. Non-government customers will manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For these customers, AAD is responsible for identifying organizationally authorized users and will enforce the access privileges defined by the customer. For more information on managing customer user identifiers and specifying access privileges in AAD via the SUE portal, see the Product1 Part 1, 2, 3 Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is used to identify and control the access privileges of each service team personnel Service teams define their roles in IDM which contain a list of eligibilities. Eligibilities vary depending on the role that a specified service team personnel will assume within the service team. Privileges are defined in the eligibilities and enforced by Active Directory. By default, these service team accounts initially belong to a security group that has remote system metadata read access, and no direct access to the production environment. If service team personnel need additional access to the production environment, they request that access and provide business justification using Just-In-Time (JIT) tools. Part e Customer Responsibility All customers, including government and non-government customers, are responsible for requiring appropriate approvals for requests to establish organizational accounts in compliance with their organizational policies. Government and non-government customers will manage their accounts in their existing Active Directory infrastructure. Non-government customers will configure account types in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer account types via the Product1 Admin Center, see the following link: <some_link> Product1In order to gain access to the production environment, service team personnel must first request access via the account management tools; access to the production environment is provided via security group membership. Approval to establish the account from the service team's management is required for a service team administrator to be added to the appropriate security group. These approvals are tracked and enforced by account management tools. Part f Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for establishing, activating, modifying, disabling, and removing organizational accounts in accordance with their procedures using their AD infrastructure. Government users utilize the government AD infrastructure to identify, authenticate, and apply permissions to that user's session. Government users communicate identification/authentication, and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. For more information on managing user accounts in Active Directory (AD), see the following link: <some_link> Non-government customers establish, activate, modify, disable, and remove organizational accounts following the same procedures outlined for government customers. Non-government customers manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link> Product1 Account changes are managed through IDM in accordance with Product1 Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) The Product1 Information Security Policy and rules have been defined in account management tools which provide an automated workflow that allows service teams to track account requests, approvals, creations, modifications, and deletions. Service team managers are responsible for approving account lifecycle events in account management tools, ensuring that Product1 establishes, activates, modifies, disables, and removes accounts appropriately. Part g Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for monitoring the use of information system accounts managed by their AD. See AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, and SI-4 for more details about theseresponsibilities. Product1 Product1 monitors the use of information system accounts in accordance with the AU family of security controls. Product1 records the auditable events defined in AU-2 with the content defined in AU-3 and monitors those records in accordance with the control descriptions for AU-6 and SI-4. Part h Customer Responsibility Part 1, 2, 3 Government and non-government customers are responsible for implementing processes to notify customer account managers when accounts are no longer required, when users are terminated or transferred, or when individual information system usage or need-to-know changes. Product1 Part 1, 2, 3 Product1 uses automated workflow account management tools that allow service teams to track the account management process through account request, approval, creation, modification, and deletion. As changes occur, the corresponding account manager is notified of the changes that require their approval. Information system usage and need-to-know are mapped to the roles defined by each service team. When an employee is transferred or their employment is terminated, the account management tools will automatically revoke the associated account's access to the privileges mapped to their previous role. Part i Customer Responsibility Part 1, 2, 3 Government customers are responsible for managing organizational user accounts by granting access to Product1 based on: a valid access authorization; intended system usage; and other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions using their AD infrastructure. Government users utilize the government AD infrastructure to identify, authenticate, and apply permissions to that user's session. Government users communicate identification/authentication, and the associated permissions to AAD viacertificate-based authentication. For more information on managing user accounts in AD, see the following link: <some_link> Non-government customers can manage organizational user accounts by granting access to Product1 based on: a valid access authorization; intended system usage; and other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link> Product1 Part 1, 2, 3 Product1 Membership in security groups that give access to the system is given only to those in specific roles that require system access. Service team managers are responsible for approving group membership. Service team personnel with the access approver role then review and approve or deny the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time (no more than 24 hours) based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus assigns the service team personnel to eligibilities with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revokes permissions at the end of the specified time period. The managers validate the eligibilities requested and justification provided and grant access once validated. Part j Customer Responsibility Product1 Customers are responsible for reviewing the accounts of their organization's users in compliance with their organizational policies. Product1 allows for customers to manage/review their user accounts via SUE. For more information on managing user accounts in AD, see the following link: <some_link> Non-government customers may manage accounts in Product2 Active Directory via the Suite User Experience (SUE) portal. Customers are responsible for logging into the portal and reviewing the Product1 MT accounts of their users compliant with their organizational policies. Disabling or removing users in the SUE portal revokes access to Product1 MT for the affected users. For more information on managing user accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>Product1 The Product1 service teams review service team administrator accounts at least monthly. Access is based on specific roles and duties to support the operational environments. The foundation is granting elevated access for a limited duration through JIT not to exceed twenty-four (24) hours; and a formal program that monitors account activities enabled by auditing account management actions. This provides ongoing review of accounts and alerts of changes. The objective is a continuous rather than static review of access authorizations and activities. Part k Customer Responsibility If government customers allow the use of group shared customer accounts, they are responsible for terminating group/shared account credentials when individuals leave the group. Non-government customers will terminate credentials using SUE. Product1 Product1 does not allow the use of shared/group service team accounts. Part l Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for aligning account management processes with personnel termination and transfer processes within their organization. Product1 Torus performs a full sync with the Human Resources Information System (HRIS) every 4 hours as well as differential syncs in near-real time. Syncs between these account management tools will revoke account access if the account no longer meets requirements for access; this could be for: inactivity, background check, clearance, EUPI attestation, or when an employee is transferred or their employment is terminated.AC-02(01) Automated System Account Management Support the management of system accounts using [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms].

Certificate-based authentication (CBA) is available to Government users to communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in AD, see the following link: <some_link>.Non-government customers can employ AD as an automated mechanism following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For customers, AAD is employed as an automated mechanism to support their organizational user accounts. For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 IDM is an automated workflow management tool that allows service teams to manage service team administrator and service accounts through account request, approval, creation, modification, and deletion. IDM integrates with Company Online Directory Service (MSODS) to provide identity synchronization, certificate management, service team administrator password resets and service team administrator provisioning from a single interface. Service team managers are responsible for approving requests in IDM. By default, service team AD accounts belong to a security group that only has read access to the production environment. Additionally, if a service team administrator needs elevated privileges to the production environment, they request that access, providing a business justification using Torus and IDM. A service team administrator with the access approver role then reviews and approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus and IDM assign the service team administrator to security groups with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revokes permissions at the end of the specified time period. Falcon, ObjectStore, and SCS also use MyAccess to manage security groups, which are used to gain access to Product2 PaaS services, Source Depot, and configuration files.

For customers using AAD the process for terminating temporary and emergency accounts will be manual. For more information on managing accounts via the SUE portal, see: <some_link>. Product1 The Company Security Program Policy (MSPP) prohibits the use of temporary and emergency accounts. All local guest accounts are disabled on the system or platform wherever they are located. All account requests follow the standard account management process. For servers that are not domain-joined, the JIT process for granting access to a serverincludes creating and enabling a local account for the duration of access. JIT sessions are task-based and have a default TTL of 4 hours and cannot exceed 24 hours, as documented in AC-2(11). When the life of an authenticator has ended, the service team member must re-request access, gain approval, and generate a new authenticator. Because this access is tied to a specific user’s domain account and requires that the user first authenticate using multifactor authentication, Product1 does not consider this local account to be a temporary account for purposes of this control. AC-02(03) Disable Accounts Disable accounts within [FedRAMP Assignment: 24 hours for user accounts] when the accounts: (a) Have expired; (b) Are no longer associated with a user or individual; (c) Are in violation of organizational policy; or (d) Have been inactive for [FedRAMP Assignment: thirty-five (35) days (See additional requirements and guidance.)].

Product1 Product1 performs automated auditing of privileged service team accounts through account management tools, which provide a record of account creation, modification, disabling, and termination of accounts. A notification is sent to the account manager when accounts are changed or managed in any way. Auditing of Product2 Portal accounts is inherited from Product2. Product2 performs auditing of privileged user accounts through an event forwarding tool, which provides a record of all changes made to accounts and notifies the Security Incident Management (SIM) team for any suspicious activities. The account management tools logs account creation, modification, and disablement actions. Monitoring is in place to record all changes to accounts in the Product2 managed domains. Alerts are generated to the workflow ticketing tool if anyone other than the members of the Online Services Security Accounts and Access team or the account management tool service account modifies a user account or security group in the Product2 managed domains.

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for establishing and administering privileged user accounts with a role-based access scheme that organizes Product1 customer privileges into roles in compliance with their organizational policies. Government customers will manage their account roles in their existing Active Directory infrastructure. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in Active Directory, see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers will manage their account roles in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see: <some_link>. Product1 All service team personnel accounts are considered privileged. Service team users are assigned to security roles, which have a defined list of available permissions. By default, service team accounts belong to a security group that only has remote access to read system metadata, and no direct access to the production environment. If a service team user needselevated privileges to the production environment, they must request that access and provide a business justification using Torus and IDM. A service team user with the access approver role then reviews and approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus and IDM assign the service team user to security groups with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revoke permissions at the end of the specified time period. Additionally, for OSI and some IS teams, service team personnel are assigned a role within their service team that corresponds to a security group. Each security group is assigned permissions to correlating environments with just enough access to properly fulfill their tasks. Service team managers are responsible for approving role assignments.

Part d Customer Responsibility Government and non-government customers are responsible for defining and taking required actions when privileged role assignments for customer users are no longer appropriate. Product1 Privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate when Product1 personnel no longer have need of the role to support their current work, or if their employment with Company is terminated. In those cases, Product4 follows the account management workflows to disable the account or revoke access. The system has the capability of terminating a user session on the Terminal Services Gateway (TSG) immediately. The TSGs are managed by Terminal Service Gateway service or inherited from Product2. First, the account associated with the user is disabled, then the session is terminated on the TSG. This prevents the user from further remote access of the system. AC-02(09) Restrictions on Use of Shared and Group Accounts Only permit the use of shared and group accounts that meet [FedRAMP Assignment: organization-defined need with justification statement that explains why such accounts are necessary].

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for enforcing the appropriate usage and time-based usage restrictions for all customer-controlled accounts. Product1 Product1 requires the use of Torus, an internal Just-In-Time (JIT) access control tool, to access the production environment. Requests for access through Torus must be approved by an eligibility owner and there are limitations to the access granted: • JIT sessions have a default TTL of 4 hours and cannot exceed 24 hours • Sessions are also task-based – all requests must include a justification and grant a restricted set of permissions that are scoped to the requested task • The management forest for Torus is isolated from, and does not trust, the management forests of other service teams, further protecting access control mechanisms from compromise This process can be circumvented only in the event of an emergency through the use of a \"breakglass\" account. There are very few of these accounts. Use of one creates a Sev 1 alert to the incident response team and causes the breakglass account password to be rotated. AC-02(12) Account Monitoring for Atypical Usage (a) Monitor system accounts for [Assignment: organization-defined atypical usage]; and (b) Report atypical usage of system accounts to [FedRAMP Assignment: at a minimum, the ISSO and/or similar role within the organization].AC-02(12) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance: AC-2 (12) (a) Requirement: Required for privileged accounts.

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for defining atypical use and monitoring for that use on their infrastructure. Government customers can additionally review Product1 application logs and analyze them for atypical use. Product1 Product1 uses Vanquish for Near Real Time (NRT) Monitoring for security alerting andmonitoring, which has two high-level methods of alerting. An alert can be configured to fire on a specific event or when multiple events correlate to show an indication of compromise. Atypical use is considered any action that falls outside of the normal baseline activity for each service team as defined by Vanquish. Part b Customer Responsibility Government and non-government customers are responsible for reporting atypical usage to defined organizational personnel. Product1 Product1 follows normal incident reporting procedures if an indication of compromise is detected. These procedures require reporting incidents to the Product1 Security Incident & Response.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for disabling user accounts posing a significant risk. Product1 The Product1 Security Incident & Response (SIR) team is notified by MSIT Corporate Security to monitor users that pose significant risk. Account management tools synchronize with the Human Resources Information System (HRIS). When a service team user is marked as disabled in HRIS, this information propagates to account management tools, which then automatically deactivates the service team domain account. Any accounts associated with the Company user are disabled in real time. AC-03 Access Enforcement Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for enforcing approved authorizations for logical access to the system, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Government users communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. Once permissions are communicated to AAD, AAD is responsible for enforcing those permissions for the users Product1 session. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in Active Directory, see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers can enforce approved authorizations for logical access to the system following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For customers using AAD, AAD is responsible for enforcing the approved authorizations set by the customer in the SUE portal. For more information on managing customer account privileges via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Product1 service teams enforce approved authorizations for logical access using role-based access control enforced by AD and Product2 Active Directory (AAD). Product1 uses AD to implement role-based access control (RBAC) via the use of AD groups. For the purposes of this control, the term \"security group\" references an AD group which is used to enforce RBAC permissions. Product1 service teams are responsible for managing security groups in the production domain. Product1 has three major account types: service team, customer, and service. Service team accounts are used by service team personnel to manage and administer Product1 Customer accounts are used by customer users to access Product1. Service accounts are used by various services to authenticate to servers and other services.AC-04 Information Flow Enforcement Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies].

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for ensuring that no information with a security impact level greater than moderate is stored, processed, or transmitted via the services provided to them by Product1. Product1 will be accredited to store, process, and transmit up to moderate Impact information as defined by NIST SP 800-60. Non-government customers are responsible for ensuring that information stored, processed, or transmitted via the services provided to them by Product1 MT is appropriate and in compliance with the risk policies of their organization. Customer Lockbox is an optional feature that customers can use for controlling the flow of information in EXO. This feature allows customers to control Company administrators\\' ability to access their content. If in response to a customer support request, a Companyadministrator needs access to customer content, that Company administrator initiates a Just In Time request which is routed to a customer administrator; this is in addition to the normal internal required access approvals. The customer administrator can then approve or deny this request via the customer administrator portal. Note that even if customers choose not to use this tool, Product1 Information Security Policy is to never access customer content unless initiated by a customer request, and access to this data is always restricted to screened personnel with required JIT approvals. Customer Lockbox places the technical enforcement of this policy within the customer\\'s direct control. For additional information, see: <some_link>. Product1 Product1 implements information flow control by allowing only connections and communication which are necessary to allow'), Document(metadata={'id': 4}, page_content=\"systems to operate, blocking all other ports, protocols and connections by default. This includes intra-service communications as well as connections to external information systems. Access Control Lists (ACLs) restrict network communications by source and destination networks, protocols, and port numbers. Product1 manages ACL and other firewall rule changes through the same configuration management processes as code changes, which includes review and approval steps. ACLs are stored in Product1's source code repository, Source Depot. ACL changes are implemented to the networking devices through various tools and APIs, including NetConf and Product2 management APIs. The use of firewall rules and ACLs allows Product1 to control the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems. The use of the RFC process ensures that data flows are authorized and approved. A detailed diagram of the Product1 dataflows, which includes all internal and external information flows, is included in this SSP. Product1 is being tested at a High Impact level to demonstrate compliance with the additional controls, but has not been sponsored for a High ATO at this time.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for preventing encrypted information from bypassing content-checking mechanisms by (one or more): decrypting the information; blocking the flow of the encrypted information; terminating communications sessions attempting to pass encrypted information; organization-defined procedures or methods. Product1 supports customer compliance with M-21-31 and M-22-09. Product1 Product1 prevents encrypted information from bypassing IDS through implementing information flow control by allowing only connections and communication which are necessary to allow systems to operate, blocking all other ports, protocols and connections by default. This includes intra-service communications as well as connections to external information systems. Access Control Lists (ACLs) are the preferred mechanism to restrict network communications by source and destination networks, protocols, and port numbers.ACLs exist at both the host and network level. Product1 manages ACL approvals through the Request For Change (RFC) process (including review and risk acceptance) and the change process, and Product2 implements the approved change. Approved mechanisms to implement networked-based ACLs include: ACLs on routers managed by Product2 and firewall rules. The use of firewall rules and ACLs allows Product1 to control the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems. The use of the RFC process ensures that data flows are authorized and approved. Service teams also employ HostIDS to further monitor for data exfiltration at the host level. NRT is used to alert based on specific security events as well as other indicators of compromise, through Vanquish, such as anomalous behavior and suspicious activity.

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for separating duties of their organizational users as necessary, to prevent malevolent activity without collusion in compliance with their organizational policies. Government customers will manage their user accounts in their existing Active Directory infrastructure. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in Active Directory, see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers manage their user accounts in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Service teams define their roles in IDM. Each role contains a list of eligibilities. Eligibilities vary depending on the role that a specified service team personnel will assume within the service team. The separation of duties is documented through eligibilities (roles) assigned to service team administrators in IDM. Each service team identifies roles that, if shared by a single person, would allow for malicious activity without collusion. When such role pairs exist, no individual is allowed to belong to both roles. Account permissions and role access are reviewed as part of the monthly account review process. Additionally, service team administrators are required to request privileged access to the production environment and provide a business justification using Torus and IDM. A different service team administrator with the access approver role then reviews and either approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus and IDM assign the service team administrator the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revoke permissions at the end of the specified time period. Implementing access control using Torus and IDM effectively prevents malevolent activity without collusion, as an individual has to review and approve the requestor's access request and would deny requests that would violate separation of duties requirements.The separation of duties is documented through eligibilities (roles) assigned to service team administrators in account management tools. Part b Product1 The separation of duties is documented through eligibilities (roles) assigned to service team administrators in IdM. Each security group in IdM has access to a specific list of eligibilities that grants specific permissions to accomplish various tasks. In order for an admin to accomplish a task in production, they must request elevation to the eligibility with the proper permissions to accomplish that task. A list of these roles can be made available to the customer upon request. AC-06 Least Privilege Employ the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned organizational tasks.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for employing the concept of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for government customer users (and processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions in compliance with their organizational policies. Government customers will manage their user accounts in their existing Active Directory infrastructure. For information regarding how to manage user account permissions in Active Directory, see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers will manage their user accounts in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing account permissions via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Product1 service teams employ the concept of least privilege, documented in IDM Roles and Eligibilities, allowing only authorized accesses for service team users (and processes acting on behalf of service team users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with business functions and organizational need. Service owners must employ the concept of least privilege for specific duties and information systems in accordance with risk assessments as necessary to adequately mitigate risk to operational assets, individuals, and/or other organizations. Service team administrator permissions and segregation of duties are defined in AC-5. Each service team is responsible for defining least privileged roles within their team. Roles are documented within IDM. Teams use Torus JIT and IDM, by default; service team accounts belong to a security group that only has remote metadata access to the environment for that service team. This does not permit direct environment access, or access to customer content. If a service team administrator needs other privileges to the production environment, they must request that access and provide a business justification using Torus and IDM. A service team administrator with the access approver role then reviews and approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus and IDM assigns the service team administrator to security groups with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revokes permissions at the end of the specified time period. The use of this Just-In-Time permissions model ensures that service team administrators only ever have the least privileges required to accomplish assigned tasks in support of Product1mission and business functions, restricted by elevation level, resource access, and time. AC-06(01) Authorize Access to Security Functions Authorize access for [Assignment: organization-defined individuals or roles] to: (a) [FedRAMP Assignment: all functions not publicly accessible]; and (b) [FedRAMP Assignment: all security-relevant information not publicly available].

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for explicitly authorizing access to security functions,as defined by their organization, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Government users communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in AD, see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers can explicitly authorize access to security functions following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For customers using AAD, the customer is responsible for authorizing access to \"tenant administration\" privileges which are used to manage user accounts and system configuration via the SUE portal. For more information on managing account privileges via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Service teams employ the concept of least privilege, allowing only pre-authorized access for service team administrators (and processes acting on behalf of service team administrators) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with business functions and organizational need. Service owners employ the concept of least privilege for specific duties and information systems (including specific ports, protocols, and services) in accordance with risk assessments as necessary to adequately mitigate risk to operational assets, individuals, and/or other organizations. All access to the Product1 system must be explicitly authorized, including the following security related functions: establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and system and security administration. Role owners are responsible for reviewing and approving role assignments, and roles are tailored for different job functions such that personnel only have the minimum access required to perform their duties. For some teams, service team accounts by default belong to a security group that only has user-level operating system access to the production environment for that service team - this does not permit access to customer content. Access to any higher level of permissions must be requested through Torus and IDM and authorized by the on-call approver. Through the use of this just in time model, Product1 explicitly authorizes access to security functions. Part bSee part a. AC-06(02) Non-privileged Access for Nonsecurity Functions Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to [FedRAMP Assignment: all security functions] use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions. AC-06(02) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance: AC-6 (2) Guidance: Examples of security functions include but are not limited to: establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters, system programming, system and security administration, other privileged functions.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for requiring that users of information system accounts/roles with access to government security functions or security-relevant information use non-privileged accounts/roles when accessing other system functions. Governmentcustomers are also responsible for auditing any use of privileged accounts/roles for such functions, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Government users communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in Active Directory see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers can require that non-government customer users of information system accounts/roles with access to security functions or security-relevant information use non-privileged accounts/roles when accessing other system functions. Non-government customers can also audit any use of privileged non-government customer accounts/roles for such functions following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage non-government customer user accounts in AAD via SUE. For customers using AAD, the customer is responsible for authorizing access to \"tenant administration\" privileges which are used to manage user accounts and system configuration via the SUE portal. Customers can elect to create a separate, non-privileged account for their administrative personnel to access other functions of Product1 MT. AAD audits all actions taken by tenant administration accounts; audit logs are retained for 90 days. For more information on managing customer account privileges via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Service teams require all individuals with administrative privileges to use their assigned accounts for performing business and security administrative functions in the production environment. Product1 requires that service team administrators of information system accounts, or roles, with access to security functions or security-relevant information, use non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing other system functions.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for auditing account creation, modification, disabling, and deletion events for their Active Directory infrastructure as these events also pertain to Product1 access. For these events, these customers are responsible for capturing what type of event occurred, when (date and time) the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the event, the outcome (success or failure) of the event, and the identity of any user/subject associated with the event. Customers using Windows servers to support their infrastructure automatically meet this requirement as Windows captures these event details by default. For more information regarding Windows event logging, see: <some_link>. Product1 Product1 includes the execution of privileged functions in the list of events to be audited bythe system. All commands run by all accounts are logged. Non-privileged actions (for example, browsing the public internet, use of email clients, etc.) are not allowed within the production environment. Additionally, some teams use just in time (JIT) tools to allow privileged access to be granted within the production environment. Execution of privileged functions using Torus and IDM is audited.

Part a Customer Responsibility Exchange Online: Exchange Online is a highly configurable service that allows organizations to control how long data is preserved and when it is deleted. By default, content deleted from Exchange can be restored for 14 days. With single item recovery and mailbox retention, customers can recover items in a mailbox upon inadvertent, malicious, or premature deletion. • Customer Administrators are responsible for configuring retention polices to meet organizational requirements when Exchange Online defaults are not adequate. • Customer Administrators are responsible for configuring retention policies consistent with recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO). • When required, Customer Administrators are responsible for increasing retention periods beyond default values. • Customer Administrators are responsible for setting retention policy locks to make retention policy configurations immutable when required to meet recovery time and recovery point objectives. For more information, see Exchange Online Data Resiliency - Company Service Assurance: <some_link> SharePoint and OneDrive:Versioning: SharePoint and OneDrive have built-in features that help protect customer information. SharePoint versioning retains a minimum of 500 versions of a file by default, files and can be configured to retain more versions if desired. The UI doesn't allow a value of fewer than 100 versions to be set, but it's possible to set the system to store fewer versions using public APIs. For reliability, any value less than 100 isn't recommended and can result in user activity causing inadvertent data loss. For more information about versioning, see Versioning in SharePoint (<some_link>). Files Restore: is the ability to go 'back in time' on any Document Library in SharePoint to any second of time in the last 30 days. This process can be used to recover from ransomware, mass deletions, corruption, or any other event. This feature uses file versions so reducing default versions can reduce the effectiveness of this restore. For more information about the Files Restore feature see: <some_link>. Preservation Hold Library: Files stored in SharePoint or OneDrive sites can be retained by applying retention policy settings. When a document with versioning is subject to retention settings, versions get copied to the Preservation Hold library and exist as a separate item. If a customer suspects their files have been compromised, they can investigate file changes by reviewing the retained copy. Customer Administrators are responsible for configuring retention policies when Preservation Hold Libraries are required. Recycle Bin: Customers are responsible for restoring corrupted files. Customers have 93 days to restore deleted data from the recycle bin. For more information, see SharePoint and OneDrive data resiliency in Company Product1 - Company: <some_link> WProduct1: Customers using WProduct1 are responsible for establishing a process for backing up their data in accordance with their organizational policies. Product1 has protections in place to preserve customer data in the event of data center failure, but customer-initiated modifications, including deletion, of data is not covered by Product1. Product1 Company Product1 workloads, including SharePoint and Exchange, are built on resiliency principles, ensuring data replication across active/active data centers in near-real time. Data utilized for restoration activities leverage the same built-in data resiliency and integrity checks applied to live data. Within Company Product1 production environments, peer replication between Product2 datacenters ensures that there are always multiple live copies of data. Product1 services utilize versioning to ensure redundancy and accuracy of information. Standard images and scripts are used to recover lost servers, and replicated data is used to restore corrupted storage.Only the following services store user-level information: CIA, EOP, EXO, Product3, SIP, ODSP, and IS. Services storing customer data will have separate instances specific to MT and GCC. Exchange Online: In Exchange Online, every mailbox is hosted in Database Availability Groups (DAGs) and replicated to geographically separate datacenters within the same region. Each mailbox database has four copies distributed across datacenters within the DAG: one active copy, two up-to-date copies, and one 7-day lagged copy used in the rare event of catastrophic logical corruption. For more information, see Exchange Online Data Resiliency - Company Service Assurance: <some_link> SharePoint and OneDrive Protection: SharePoint and OneDrive Protection have built-in features that help protect customer information. For SharePoint and OneDrive, files are written simultaneously to a primary and secondary datacenter region. Multiple types of checksums are stored within metadata in a separate location; corresponding files are used to ensure data integrity through all stages of the data lifecycle. • File hash stored in metadata: Hash of the entire file is stored with file metadata to ensure document level data integrity is maintained during all operations • Blob hash stored in metadata: Each blob-item stores a hash of the encrypted content to protect against corruption in underlying Product2 storage. • Data integrity job: Every 14 days, each site is scanned for integrity by listing items in the database and matching those up with listed blobs in Product2 storage. The job reports any blob-references missing storage-blobs and can retrieve those blobs through the Product2 storage soft-delete feature if needed. For more information, see SharePoint and OneDrive data resiliency in Company Product1 - Company: <some_link> Product3: Teams chats are stored within Exchange Online user mailboxes and files are stored in either SharePoint or OneDrive. Company Teams data is protected by the controls and recovery mechanisms available within these services. For more information, see Service resilience in Company Teams - Company ServiceAssurance: <some_link> Product2-leveraged Services: Product1 services leveraging Product2 storage solutions inherit backup capabilities from Product2. For user-level information in Product2 Storage, data is synchronously replicated locally using Locally Redundant Storage (LRS), which provides redundancy equivalent to three copies. In addition, data is asynchronously replicated to a separate datacenter in the zone or to a remote region for accounts which have configured Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS), Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS), or Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS). The backups sent to Product2 Storage are encrypted using Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 compliant AES 256-bit encryption. For information on data integrity, refer to: <some_link> Part b Customer Responsibility Customers are responsible for backing up system-level information relating to their use of WProduct1 Cloud PCs. Product1 All system-level information required for service restoral is securely stored within CorpNet. This is achieved through internal code repository tools, namely Product2 DevOps and Source Depot. Product2 DevOps, which utilizes GIT, provides version control to support secure change management processes. For data integrity, Product2 Storage regularly monitors and verifies data stored using cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs). If data corruption is detected, it's repaired using redundant copies. Product2 DevOps relies on both Product2 Blob Storage and Product2 SQL Database to help protect data during hardware or service failures. Product2 Storage geo-replicates data between two regions in the same geographical location. For Product2 Blob Storage, data is replicated three times within a single region. Data is replicated asynchronously to a second region in the same geographical location. As such, Product1 always maintains the equivalent of six copies of data. The use of multiple copies enables failover to a separate region if there's a major outage or disaster, while also having local redundancy for hardware failures within the region. For Product2 SQL Database storage, daily backups are maintained offsite if there's a regional disaster. To safeguard against accidental data loss, Company employs point-in-time backups for both blobs stored in Product2 Blob Storage and databases within Product2 SQL Database. Eachstorage account maintains a separate copy of all blobs, with changes being appended to the existing data. These backups are immutable, eliminating the need to rewrite any existing storage during backup procedures. Product2 SQL Database includes standard backup features, which are utilized by Product2 DevOps. Data is retained for 28 days, with these backups also being replicated in a paired region to facilitate recovery during a regional outage. For more information, see: <some_link>. Part c Product1 All system documentation is securely stored within CorpNet. Use of Product2 IaaS/PaaS services is inherited from Product2. Product1 maintains backups of system documentation, including security-related and privacy-related documentation, through SharePoint or within Product2 DevOps. SharePoint uses versioning and is replicated in near real-time. SharePoint and OneDrive Protection: SharePoint and OneDrive Protection have built-in features that help protect system documentation. • Versioning: Retains a minimum of 500 versions of a file by default and can be configured to retain more, if system documentation is corrupted, a previous version of the file can be recovered. • Files Restore: is the ability to go 'back in time' on any Document Library in SharePoint to any second of time in the last 30 days. This process can be used to recover from ransomware, mass deletions, corruption, or any other event. For more information about the Files Restore feature see: <some_link>. • Recycle bin: If system documentation is inadvertently deleted, the recycle bin will store data for 93 days before permanent deletion. After the 93-day recycle pipeline is complete, deletion takes place independently for Metadata and for Blob Storage. Metadata is removed immediately from the database, which makes the content unreadable unless the metadata is restored from backup. SharePoint maintains 14 days-worth of backups of metadata. These backups are taken locally in near real time and then pushed to storage in redundant Product2 Storage containers on a 5-10-minute schedule. • File hash stored in metadata: Hash of the entire file is stored with file metadata to ensure document level data integrity is maintained during all operations • Blob hash stored in metadata: Each blob-item stores a hash of the encrypted content to protect against corruption in underlying Product2 storage. • Data integrity job: Every 14 days, each site is scanned for integrity by listing items in thedatabase and matching those up with listed blobs in Product2 storage. The job reports any blob-references missing storage-blobs and can retrieve those blobs through the Product2 storage soft-delete feature if needed.

Part d Customer Responsibility WProduct1 customers are responsible for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of customer-controlled backup data. Product1 Product1 configures Product2 services appropriately to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup or versioning data. Use of Product2 services inherited from Product2.Product1 protects the confidentiality and integrity of all customer information through the use of Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant TLS 1.2/1.3 protocols and AES 256-bit encryption. In instances where information is uploaded to Product2 Storage, data is automatically encrypted. As part of the drive to ensure that Company is only using cryptographically secure protocol versions, all teams within Product1 are provided guidance to deprecate older protocols and ciphers. Service Teams are only allowed to leverage TLS 1.2/1.3 and higher protocols for both incoming and outgoing connections. Product1 leverages Key Performance Indicator (KPI) alerting system to ensure service teams are only leveraging TLS 1.2/1.3 and higher protocols. The KPIs are alerted to Product1 service and leadership teams for actions. For more information on Product2-leveraged infrastructure for integrity and availability of data, see Data redundancy - Product2 Storage: <some_link> For more information on how Product1 protects the availability of customer data, see part a. CP-09(01) Testing for Reliability and Integrity Test backup information [FedRAMP Assignment: at least monthly] to verify media reliability and information integrity. CP-09(01) Control Summary Information Responsible Role: Customer Administrator, Product2, Service Engineer Operations Parameter CP-09(01): At least monthly Implementation Status (check all that apply): ☐ Implemented ☐ Partially implemented ☐ Planned ☒ Alternative implementation ☐ Not applicable Control Origination (check all that apply): ☐ Service Provider Corporate ☐ Service Provider System Specific ☐ Service Provider Hybrid (Corporate and System Specific) ☐ Configured by Customer (Customer System Specific) ☐ Provided by Customer (Customer System Specific) ☒ Shared (Service Provider and Customer Responsibility) ☒ Inherited from pre-existing authorization for Product2 Government (F1603087869), 4/17/2020CP-09(01) What is the solution and how is it implemented? Customer Responsibility Customers are responsible for utilizing features of Product1 to restore any data that has been lost or corrupted. Customers are also responsible for periodic testing and validation of recovery procedures. Product1 Company Product1 workloads, including SharePoint and Exchange, are built on resiliency principles, ensuring data replication across active/active data centers in near-real time. Data utilized for restoration activities leverage the same built-in data resiliency and integrity checks applied to live data. Within Company Product1 production environments, peer replication between Product2 datacenters ensures that there are always multiple live copies of data. Standard images and scripts are used to recover lost servers, and replicated data is used to restore corrupted storage. Exchange Online: In Exchange Online, every mailbox is hosted in Database Availability Groups (DAGs) and replicated to geographically separate datacenters within the same region. Each mailbox database has four copies distributed across datacenters within the DAG: one active copy, two up-to-date copies, and one 7-day lagged copy used in the rare event of catastrophic logical corruption. Log File Checks: All transaction log files generated by an Exchange database undergo several forms of consistency checks. When a log file is created, the first thing done is a bit pattern is written and then a series of log writes is performed. This structure enables Exchange Online to execute a series of checks (lost flush, CRC, and other checks) to validate each log file as it is written, and again as it\\'s replicated. Resilient File System: To help prevent corruption from occurring at the file system level, Exchange Online is being deployed on Resilient File System (ReFS) partitions to provide improved recovery capabilities. ReFS is a file system that is designed to be more resilient against data corruption thereby maximizing data availability and integrity. Specifically, ReFS brings improvements in the way that metadata is updated which offers better protection for data and reduces data corruption cases. It also uses checksums to verify the integrity of file data and metadata ensuring that data corruption is easily found and repaired. For more information, see Exchange Online Data Resiliency - Company Service Assurance: <some_link> SharePoint and OneDrive Protection:SharePoint and OneDrive Protection have built-in features that help protect customer information. For SharePoint and OneDrive, files are written simultaneously to a primary and secondary datacenter region. Multiple types of checksums are stored within metadata in a separate location; corresponding files are used to ensure data integrity through all stages of the data lifecycle. • File hash stored in metadata: Hash of the entire file is stored with file metadata to ensure document level data integrity is maintained during all operations • Blob hash stored in metadata: Each blob-item stores a hash of the encrypted content to protect against corruption in underlying Product2 storage. • Data integrity job: Every 14 days, each site is scanned for integrity by listing items in the database and matching those up with listed blobs in Product2 storage. The job reports any blob-references missing storage-blobs and can retrieve those blobs through the Product2 storage soft-delete feature if needed. For more information, see SharePoint and OneDrive data resiliency in Company Product1 - Company: <some_link> Product3: Teams chats are stored within Exchange Online user mailboxes and files are stored in either SharePoint or OneDrive. Company Teams data is protected by the controls and recovery mechanisms available within these services. For more information, see Service resilience in Company Teams - Company Service Assurance: <some_link> System Data & System Documentation: Company ensures that backups of Company Product1 system documentation and system data needed for service restoration are securely kept within CorpNet. This is achieved through SharePoint\\'s inherent data resilience capabilities and internal code repository tools, namely Product2 DevOps and Source Depot. For data integrity, Product2 Storage regularly monitors and verifies data stored using cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs). If data corruption is detected, it\\'s repaired using redundant copies. Product2 Storage also calculates checksums on all network traffic to detect corruption of data packets when storing or retrieving data. CRC checks are performed prior to replication of data as well as periodically - once a month for HDDs, twice a month for SSDs. CRC calculations are tested against values stored in metadata to ensure data integrity within Product2 storage. For information on data integrity and Product2 DevOps refer to: Data redundancy - Product2 Storage <some_link>Data protection overview - Product2 DevOps Services <some_link> For additional details on how Product2 further protects Product1 data within Product2 storage using data-at-rest protections, see Product2\\'s SSP SC-28.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for uniquely identifying and authenticating their organizational users via their Active Directory infrastructure. When a user of an organization attempts to access Product1, the user is redirected to a login page. The user provides their credentials and a login request is created backed by a X.509 certificate and authenticated by AAD. Customers are responsible for enforcing organizationally appropriate identification and authentication requirements including the use of unique identifiers.For more information on Active Directory object naming, see: <some_link>. Non-government customers inherit these controls from AAD. When users enter their username at the Product1 MT hosted login screen, AAD matches the user\\'s domain to the appropriate Active Directory Organizational Unit and attempts to establish a secure session with the user\\'s client. Once the session is established, AAD validates the user\\'s authenticators and issues the user a SAML ticket containing information about the user\\'s unique identity and group membership. Customer administrators use the SUE administration portal to set identification and authentication requirements for their organization. AAD enforces unique identifiers for these customers. For more information on Active Directory object naming, see: <some_link>. Product1 Product1 uses Product2 Active Directory (AAD) for identifying, Torus for authenticating access for Company users in the environment. Product1 personnel accessing Product1 are uniquely identified by their AD or AAD username and authenticate using FIPS 140-2 Validated YubiKey 5 (#3914) and FIPS 140-2 Compliant YubiKey 4 (#3517) or approved FIPS 140-2 compliant TPM modules.

Active Directory Forest members are uniquely identified by Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) with device authentication performed using Kerberos, which is a part of the Windows networking protocols. Virtual machines are identified by the virtual machine deployment ID assigned by Product2 and authenticated via TSL certificates managed as part of the Product2 provisioning process. When establishing a Company Product2 subscription, a subscription ID is created. The Fabric Controller (FC), which manages all VMs in Company Product2, uses this subscription ID to tie VMs to particular subscriptions. For more information about the Fabric Controller see the Product2 SSP. For teams managed by PilotFish, an identity certificate is distributed to every machine on a PilotFish cluster. Each identity certificate contains a unique identifier (machine name), the environment, and machine function (server role).IA-07 Cryptographic Module Authentication Implement mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meet the requirements of applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines for such authentication.

Customer Responsibility Government customers do not have access to request cryptographic certificates from Product1. If they require cryptographic certificates, they must follow their organizational procedures to procure certificates from a valid certificate authority. Product1 Product1 implements FIPS 140-2 encryption mechanisms on all communications between partners and between customers using cryptographic certificates issued by CertDojo which are anchored to the Company Root Certificate Authority. In this implementation, the Company Root Certificate Authority is the cryptographic module for Product1. In order to request a cryptographic certificate, an Product1 service team administrator must be authenticated to the MSIT managed corporate network. The Product1 service team administrator navigates to the internal Company site <http://ssladmin> to request a certificate. The request is routed to the administrator's manager for approval. Once the certificate is issued, the administrator usestwo factor authentication to access Product1 servers to install the certificate. This process meets the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for authentication to a cryptographic module.

Customer Responsibility Product1 government customers are responsible for determining users who have access to their information system. Thus, the responsibility is incumbent upon the customer to uniquely identify and authenticate non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users) who should have system access. The government customer can invite guests and non-organizational users to SPO, Product3, but the guest must be authorized/admitted to the session by the credentialed government customer user for Product3. It is the responsibility of the government customer to follow theirown Rules of Behavior and policies around inviting guests to their systems. Product1 Product1 does not allow any non-organizational users to authenticate to production systems. Government customer users are considered organizational and are covered via IA-2. If government customers decide to allow access to non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of a non-organizational user), they must ensure that such users or processes are uniquely identified and authenticated using credentials that meet or exceed the set of minimum federal government-wide technical, security, privacy, and organizational requirements.

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for ensuring that customer users are using secure browsers and properly patched information systems to access Product1.WProduct1: Government customers utilizing WProduct1 services are responsible for identifying, reporting, and correcting information system flaws on their own VMs. Product1 Product1 identifies, reports, and corrects information system flaws through vulnerability management, incident response management, and patch/configuration management processes. The Product1 Security Incident Response Program assists with identifying and reporting of information system flaws. Product1 receives vulnerability-related data from multiple sources of information which include: Company Security Resource Center (MSRC), vendor Web sites, other third-party services (e.g. Internet Security Systems) and internal/external vulnerability scanning of services. Product1 Security will determine which updates are applicable within the Product1 environment. Potential changes are tested in advance. Patching schedules are defined by Product1 Security to install security-relevant software and firmware updates within 30 days for high vulnerabilities, 90 days for moderate vulnerabilities. Additionally, the Product1 TVR team and Product2 analyze and test vendor-supplied software (Qualys scan engine). Flaws found during testing are reported to the appropriate vendor, and vendor patches are tested and applied as they are received. Product1 inherits firmware changes from Product2, which is responsible for firmware updates to the Product1 infrastructure. Services with inherited compute also inherit this control from Product2. Product2. For containers, when patches are available, a new container image is pulled from Company Container Registry (MCR) and prepped for use. A new build is also created when components added to the MCR container image need to be patched. Part b Product1 Product1 service teams test potential software changes prior to deployment, either in a separate test environment, or by removing a server from production, making changes, testing, and returning it to production upon successful completion.

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for ensuring that customer users are using information systems running anti-malware software to access Product1. Product1 The use of anti-malware software is a principal mechanism for protection of Product1 assets from malicious software. The software detects and prevents the introduction of computer viruses, malware, rootkits, worms, and other malicious software onto the service systems. Anti-malware software provides both preventive and detective control over malicious software. System Center Endpoint Protection (SCEP), Windows Defender, Forefront Endpoint Protection (FEP) or Company Endpoint Protection (MEP) is installed as part of the initial build on all systems. Additionally, IP scans and quarantines in real time all email and email attachments both entering and leaving the system for viruses and other malware. Part b Product1 Each anti-malware package tracks the version of the software and what signatures are running. The automatic download and application of signature updates when available from the vendor\\'s virus definition site is centrally managed by the appropriate anti-malware tool for each service team in accordance with the team\\'s defined change management processes. EXO applies Safe Deployment Practices (SDP) to Defender signatures after a malformed signature update caused a high severity incident. Signature updates follow a ringed deployment on a weekly cadence, but the SDP process introduces a slight delay in these signatures reaching the production environment. Testing signature updates in preproduction environments help ensure stability of the information system, but also contributes to a signature update interval of approximately 15 days. Part c Product1 Part 1CIA, CII , Delve, EXO, Falcon, IP, IS, TSG, OSI, Profile Card, SCS, SPO, SUE, WProduct1: The following functions are centrally managed by'), Document(metadata={'id': 12}, page_content='the appropriate anti-malware tool on each endpoint for each service team: • Periodic scans of the file system (at least weekly) • Real-time scans of files as they are downloaded, opened, or executed Anti-malware tools detect files determined to be malicious and send alerts to Product1 administrators, which triggers the incident response process. PDRS, Product3, ObjectStore, Product4 for Web: PilotFish utilizes real-time scanning of files as they are downloaded, opened, or executed. If the scanning tool is disabled, a Sev 1 alert is generated. PilotFish also monitors for changes to its desired state; deviations from this state will automatically mark the host as unhealthy, remove it from the network, and subsequently tear it down and rebuild. Anti-malware tools detect files determined to be malicious and send alerts to Product1 administrators, which triggers the incident response process. Part 2 When anti-malware tools detect malware in a real-time scan, they block it and an alert is generated and sent to Product1 service team personnel, Product1 Security, and/or Product2 OSSC. When anti-malware tools detect malware in a periodic scan, the malware is quarantined. The receiving personnel initiate the Incident Response process. Incidents are tracked and resolved, and postmortem analysis is performed, as discussed in the Product1 Security Incident Response Plan. Acceptable output from MpPreference includes a setting of \\'0\\' or \\'2,\\' both of which will quarantine detected threats and initiate the Incident Response process.

Part a Product1 Part 1 Service teams have deployed Near Real Time monitoring solutions that generate all real-time alerts and audit logs from both SCOM and the repository. All the service team-specific monitoring requirements beyond the base set defined in Product1 Security Auditing SOP for Product1 are integrated into a SCOM pack. In addition, service teams upload their logs to a repository service, where they are aggregated and processed. The uploader service generates reports using automated security alerting tools. These automated security alerting tools assist in identifying normal usage of the system and deviations from that normal range. Additionally, they examine records to confirm that the system is functioning in an optimal, resilient, and secure state. Unusual activity is flagged and alerted in Near Real Time. The repository also aggregates logs for further review. Any log event that indicates a potential security violation must be immediately brought to the attention of Product1 Security. Teams using PilotFish use K9, a tool that collects security logs and performs real-time analysis, as well as archiving them to a repository service for forensic analysis. Unusual activity will generate alerts and the PilotFish team coordinates with the appropriate service team for any required follow-ups or investigations. Service teams will work with the Product1 SIR team to address all security incidents.Part 2 Local connections are disallowed by policy within Product4. No personnel have local access. Product2 performs network monitoring and detection of unauthorized connections in accordance with their security policy. Monitoring is also inherited for services using inherited compute from Product2. Remote authentication failures are logged and stored within a repository service. For further information, please see AC-17 and AC-7. Part b Product1 Audit logs are uploaded to repository and reports are generated using automated security alerting tools. These automated security alerting tools assist in identifying normal usage of the system and deviations from that normal range. The automated security alerting tools use heuristics to identify unauthorized use of the operating system. Unusual activity is flagged and alerted in near real time and a repository aggregates logs for further review. Any log event that indicates a potential security violation must be immediately brought to the attention of Product1 Security. For services using inherited compute via Product2, this control is inherited from Product2. For teams using PilotFish, audit logs are uploaded to a repository service and reports are generated using PilotFish/K-9. PilotFish/K-9 assists in identifying normal usage of the system and deviations from that normal range. PilotFish/K-9 uses heuristics to identify unauthorized use of the operating system. Unusual activity is flagged for further review. Any log event that indicates a potential security violation must be immediately brought to the attention of Product1 Security. Part c Product1 Part 1 All servers act as monitoring devices and are configured to log all security-relevant events. Product1 monitors and alerts in Near Real Time for all hosts in the environment. Suspicious events generate alarms and notifications to service team staff and appropriate contingent staff. Logs are aggregated in a repository service and reports are generated using the automated security alerting tools. For teams using PilotFish, all servers act as monitoring devices and are configured to log all security-relevant events. Product1 monitors all hosts in the environment. Suspicious eventsgenerate alarms and notifications to service team staff and appropriate contingent staff. Logs are aggregated in a repository service and reports are generated using PilotFish/K-9. Part 2 All servers are configured to log all exceptions and security-relevant events. Additionally, Product1 monitors all devices and has those logs exported to a centralized system for aggregated alerting/monitoring. Therefore, Product1 has determined that there is no need for ad-hoc deployment of monitoring devices as documented in \"Ad-hoc Monitoring Devices Decision Log (SI-4)\". Part d Product1 Audit logs are uploaded to a repository service from all servers in the Product1 environment. Each service team receives near real-time alerting on security events through various alerting tools and reports can be generated from the alerts and from the uploader service. Each team is responsible for reviewing and analyzing the alerts for indications of inappropriate or unusual activity, including indications of compromise. Findings are reported and escalated using standard security incident management channels: Tickets are opened to track these security incidents using ticket tracking software and the Product1 Security team is engaged when appropriate. All servers upload logs to a repository service for aggregation and analysis. Handling and access to event and anomaly data is detailed in the AU family of controls. Part e Product1 Product1 Security notifies service teams if a change in the level of monitoring is necessary due to indications of increased risk, and service teams adjust monitoring accordingly. Servers are configured to increase logging parameters in response to an indication of increased risk, and the automated security alerting tools heuristics are tailored to look for specific threats, in conjunction with any alerts received via NRT Security Monitoring, based on the nature of the risk to organizational operations and assets. Part f Product1 Product1 Security, in consultation with Corporate External Legal Affairs (CELA), has defined aset of log events and alerts that meet federal regulatory requirements for incident management and investigation. This structure is intended to support identification of known suspicious activity and to support the investigation of misuse and abuse of Product1 services. To fully comply with applicable regulations, the service teams follow defined requirements for event collection and notification processes. These requirements are contained in the Product1 Security and PilotFish/K-9 onboarding document. Part g Product1 All servers upload logs to a repository service for aggregation and analysis. Reports are generated from this data using NRT Security Monitoring and the automated security alerting tools as described AU-6 and AU-7. These reports are available daily and as needed.

Product1 Service teams operate active monitoring systems that generate automated real-time alerts and audit logs from both SCOM and the uploader service. These automated tools perform analysis and trigger emails to Service Team Engineering groups when a specified threshold has been reached or event has occurred. Upon receipt, Service Team Engineering personnel uses a ticketing tool and creates a'), Document(metadata={'id': 13}, page_content=\"bug to analyze and track the issue and follow incident response procedures. Teams using PilotFish use K9, a tool that collects security logs and performs real-time analysis. Unusual activity generates alerts, and the PilotFish team coordinates with the appropriate service team for any required follow-ups or investigations. Service teams will work with the Product1 SIR team to address all security incidents. For services using inherited compute via Product2, this control is inherited from Product2. SI-04(04) Inbound and Outbound Communications Traffic (a) Determine criteria for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions for inbound and outbound communications traffic; (b) Monitor inbound and outbound communications traffic [FedRAMP Assignment: continuously] for [Assignment: organization-defined unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions].

Part a Product1 Product2 monitors for unusual traffic patterns using OneDDOS. In addition, service teams monitor for denial of service attacks by monitoring the following key health metrics: CPU usage, network connections, disk input/output operations per second (IOPS), and disk space usage. Product1 service teams also monitor and review web server (e.g. IIS) logs and other application logs (as applicable) for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions. Any unapproved connections detected through auditing or alerting will be triaged using security incident response processes. Part b Product1 See Part (a). SI-04(05) System-generated Alerts Alert [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] when the following system-generated indications of compromise or potential compromise occur: [Assignment: organization-defined compromise indicators].

Product1 Product1 Security has defined requirements for active monitoring. Service teams configure active monitoring tools in accordance with these requirements. Active monitoring tools include Near Real Time Security Monitoring (NRT Security Monitoring), System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) and the automated security alerting tools, which are configured to provide real time alerts to Service Team Operations personnel in situations that require immediate action. Service Team Operations personnel act as the designee of the SCA / ISSO. For teams using PilotFish use K-9 which is configured to provide real time alerts to Service Team Operations personnel in situations that require immediate action. The list of events being monitored is stored on each respective team's SharePoint site. For services using inherited compute via Product2, this control is inherited from Product2.SI-04(10) Visibility of Encrypted Communications Make provisions so that [Assignment: organization-defined encrypted communications traffic] is visible to [Assignment: organization-defined system monitoring tools and mechanisms]. SI-04(10) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance: SI-4 (10) Requirement: The service provider must support Agency requirements to comply with M-21-31 SI-04(10) Control Summary Information Responsible Role: Customer Administrator Parameter SI-04(10)-1: none Parameter SI-04(10)-2: none Implementation Status (check all that apply): ☐ Implemented ☐ Partially implemented ☐ Planned ☐ Alternative implementation ☒ Not applicable Control Origination (check all that apply): ☐ Service Provider Corporate ☐ Service Provider System Specific ☐ Service Provider Hybrid (Corporate and System Specific) ☐ Configured by Customer (Customer System Specific) ☐ Provided by Customer (Customer System Specific) ☒ Shared (Service Provider and Customer Responsibility) ☐ Inherited from pre-existing authorization SI-04(10) What is the solution and how is it implemented? Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for making provisions so that customer-defined encrypted communications traffic are visible to information system monitoring tools. Product1 This control does not apply to Product1. Product1 does not inspect or monitor customer traffic. By default, Product1 is unaware of what data is outbound from the environment by thecustomer. In the event of customer data spillage, upon customer request, Product1 may assist with the incident including accessing customer data according to the Product1 Incident Response Policies and Procedures. SI-04(1 1) Analyze Communications Traffic Anomalies Analyze outbound communications traffic at the external interfaces to the system and selected [Assignment: organization-defined interior points within the system] to discover anomalies.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for analyzing communications traffic anomalies for customer-deployed resources, including an analysis of outbound communications traffic at the external boundary and at customer-defined interior points within the system to discover anomalies.Product1 Product1 monitors for and protects against mining of system data and customer content. All access to Product1 occurs through remote access to the TSG or Product2 managed Terminal Services Gateways (TSG). The Product1 Security team monitors remote access for any large data exfiltration through the TSGs. Product1 Security uses a robust security monitoring and alerting tool to ingest logs from hosts and other networking infrastructure in the environment, compare these logs to an extensive ruleset, and alert Security personnel when a match is found between the two. Service teams also employ HostIDS to further monitor for data exfiltration at the host level. NRT is used to alert based on specific security events as well as other indicators of compromise such as anomalous behavior and suspicious activity. In addition, access to the Product1 system is limited to a small number of Product1 cleared service team administrators. Product1 cleared service team administrators have taken role-based access training, security awareness training and have been background screened. If Product1 becomes aware of any unlawful access to any customer content stored in its equipment or in its facilities, or unauthorized access to such equipment or facilities resulting in loss, disclosure, or alteration of customer content (each considered a security incident), Product1 will: (a) notify the affected customer of the security incident; (b) investigate the security incident and provide the customer with information about the security incident; and (c) take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the security incident. In the event of customer data spillage, upon customer request, Product1 may assist with the incident including accessing customer data according to the Product1 Incident Response Policies and Procedures. SI-04(12) Automated Organization-generated Alerts Alert [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] using [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms] when the following indications of inappropriate or unusual activities with security or privacy implications occur: [Assignment: organization-defined activities that trigger alerts].

Customer Responsibility Customers are responsible for monitoring and alerting security personnel of any unusual activities for systems that connect to Product1. Product1 Product1 automated security monitoring and alerting tools generate real time alerts and audit logs from both SCOM and the repository service. These automated tools perform analysis and trigger emails to Service Team Engineering groups when a specified threshold has been reached or event has occurred. Upon receipt, Service Team Engineering personnel use a ticketing tool and create a bug to analyze and track the issue and follow incident response procedures.\")]\n",

The CO specifies the set of actions taken by authorized users (AAU) during the operation of the product.\\n\\nThe CO specifies the following set of actions:\\n\\n1. A User (AU) requests access to an area within the product that has been allocated to them.\\n2. A User (AU) executes a login request by sending their username and password as credentials in the HTTP request.\\n3. The System (S) validates the login request using the stored credentials or other authentication mechanisms available within the CO.\\n4. Once the login request is validated successfully, the System (S) grants access to the requested area within the product.\\n\\nTherefore, the Control Origination (CO) for AC-06 specifies a set of actions taken by authorized users (AAU) during the operation of the product.\\n\\nThese actions specify how authorized users can request access to specific areas within the product and how their requests will be validated. The CO also specifies other authentication mechanisms available within the CO, such as stored credentials, external authentication mechanisms, etc., to further validate and secure user authentication within the product.'"

Part a Customer Responsibility All customers, including government and non-government customers, are responsible for identifying the account types for their organization in compliance with their organizational policies. Customers will configure their account types in their existing Active Directory infrastructure or they will configure account types in AAD. Non-government customers will configure account types in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer account types via the Product1 Admin Center, see the following link: Guest access to Product3 meetings, if enabled, allows anyone with a meeting invite to access the meeting lobby; this method of guest access is considered session access as no account is assigned to the guest user. The meeting organizer is responsible for establishing the identity of lobby participants before granting them access to the meeting. Government customers are responsible for disabling guest access to Product3 meetings to remain compliant with FedRAMP standards as advised in \"Product1 Complementary Federal User Entity Control\". Non-government customers are responsible for determining if the use of guest access to Product3 meetings should be allowed for their organization. This setting can be configured by government and non-government customers. SharePoint Online guest invitations allow external users to access an organization\\'s SharePoint Online site(s). Government and non-government customers are responsible for determining if the use of guest access to SharePoint Online, as an account type, should be allowed for their organization. Government customers are responsible for disabling guest access to SharePoint Online to remain compliant with FedRAMP standards. The setting to allow or disallow guest access to SharePoint Online can be configured by government and non-government customers. For more information, see the Company Product1 Solution and Architecture Center: Product1 Product1 accounts are only provided to Company personnel supporting Product1 services. Accounts with permissions to internal assets and resources are not provisioned to customers. Company personnel are assigned unique corporate network (CorpNet) AD accounts as part of a standard onboarding to Company. These CorpNet accounts, known as user alias\\', do not have access to any production environment by default.For personnel supporting Product1 services, service team accounts are used to manage and administer Product1. Service team accounts tie to the user\\'s CorpNet account. This alias is consistent across all of the user\\'s accounts in all Company domains, including Product1. CorpNet and Product1 access are provisioned and managed using separate account management tools. Below are the different account types that Product1 utilizes: Standard Access All personnel with standard access to Product1 are granted system metadata read access used for regular troubleshooting, release management, and other maintenance and monitoring activities. Standard access provides permissions to key Product1 tools, services, SharePoint sites, documentation, and a variety of dashboards. Standard access does not provide access into the production environment. A user with standard access may have the need to review service-specific logs within Product1 to identify and diagnose issues. Any additional permissions above standard access requires elevation of access via Torus JIT, described below. Elevated Access All personnel must use JIT when interactive elevated access is required in the Product1 production environment. Except in the case of an approved exception as described below, there is no standing or persistent elevated access to the production environment. The primary exception is Break-Glass elevated access, described below. In scenarios where JIT does not yet support management of elevated access, standing access may exist; these gaps in JIT support are identified and tracked as an exception, which requires approval. Software deployment via automated means (i.e., not using an interactive login) does not require interactive login to a resource that is accessed via JIT. In this case, a service team member submits a job (e.g., Pull Request in Product2 DevOps), and another team member reviews, approves, and then the safe deployment system deploys. Elevated Access – Break-Glass Access Product1 maintains Break-Glass accounts with elevated access for use in the scenario that the JIT service is not available. These accounts have persistent elevated access to perform maintenance activities if JIT is unable to provide temporary elevated access. These accounts are carefully managed, only to be used in emergencies, and have notifications associated with their use. Whenever such an account is utilized, a Severity 2 incident ticket is generated that requires the service that owns the resource to investigate and determine whether the access is valid. Service Accounts Non-user, non-interactive service accounts are used to run relevant services. Service accounts are not used for interactive logins. For example, software deployment via automatedmeans does not require interactive login to a resource that would normally be accessed via JIT. In this example, a service team member submits a job, such as a Pull Request in Product2 DevOps, and another team member reviews and approves. Part b Customer Responsibility All customers, including government and non-government customers, are responsible for assigning account managers for the account types identified in part a of this control. Product1 Product1 assigns account managers to each role type using IDM, which include workflows that enforce business rules. Throughout this SSP, these tools are collectively referenced as \"account management tools\". Part c Customer Responsibility All customers, including government and non-government customers, are responsible for establishing conditions for group/role membership for their organization in compliance with their organizational policies. Non-government customers will configure groups in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer groups/roles in AAD via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Service teams establish conditions for group/role membership by defining and enforcing conditions for each group/role in account management tools. In addition, service teams use Torus and IDM to enforce additional, more granular conditions for privilege escalation and approval for interactive sessions. Product1 establishes conditions for group and role membership based on least privilege necessary for a user to perform their assigned duties. Predetermined conditions are established when groups are created.

\"apply permissions to that user's session. Customers communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. Non-government customers will manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For these customers, AAD is responsible for identifying organizationally authorized users and will enforce the access privileges defined by the customer. For more information on managing customer user identifiers and specifying access privileges in AAD via the SUE portal, see the Product1 Part 1, 2, 3 Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is used to identify and control the access privileges of each service team personnel Service teams define their roles in IDM which contain a list of eligibilities. Eligibilities vary depending on the role that a specified service team personnel will assume within the service team. Privileges are defined in the eligibilities and enforced by Active Directory. By default, these service team accounts initially belong to a security group that has remote system metadata read access, and no direct access to the production environment. If service team personnel need additional access to the production environment, they request that access and provide business justification using Just-In-Time (JIT) tools. Part e Customer Responsibility All customers, including government and non-government customers, are responsible for requiring appropriate approvals for requests to establish organizational accounts in compliance with their organizational policies. Government and non-government customers will manage their accounts in their existing Active Directory infrastructure. Non-government customers will configure account types in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer account types via the Product1 Admin Center, see the following link: <some_link> Product1In order to gain access to the production environment, service team personnel must first request access via the account management tools; access to the production environment is provided via security group membership. Approval to establish the account from the service team's management is required for a service team administrator to be added to the appropriate security group. These approvals are tracked and enforced by account management tools. Part f Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for establishing, activating, modifying, disabling, and removing organizational accounts in accordance with their procedures using their AD infrastructure. Government users utilize the government AD infrastructure to identify, authenticate, and apply permissions to that user's session. Government users communicate identification/authentication, and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. For more information on managing user accounts in Active Directory (AD), see the following link: <some_link> Non-government customers establish, activate, modify, disable, and remove organizational accounts following the same procedures outlined for government customers. Non-government customers manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link> Product1 Account changes are managed through IDM in accordance with Product1 Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) The Product1 Information Security Policy and rules have been defined in account management tools which provide an automated workflow that allows service teams to track account requests, approvals, creations, modifications, and deletions. Service team managers are responsible for approving account lifecycle events in account management tools, ensuring that Product1 establishes, activates, modifies, disables, and removes accounts appropriately. Part g Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for monitoring the use of information system accounts managed by their AD. See AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, and SI-4 for more details about theseresponsibilities. Product1 Product1 monitors the use of information system accounts in accordance with the AU family of security controls. Product1 records the auditable events defined in AU-2 with the content defined in AU-3 and monitors those records in accordance with the control descriptions for AU-6 and SI-4. Part h Customer Responsibility Part 1, 2, 3 Government and non-government customers are responsible for implementing processes to notify customer account managers when accounts are no longer required, when users are terminated or transferred, or when individual information system usage or need-to-know changes. Product1 Part 1, 2, 3 Product1 uses automated workflow account management tools that allow service teams to track the account management process through account request, approval, creation, modification, and deletion. As changes occur, the corresponding account manager is notified of the changes that require their approval. Information system usage and need-to-know are mapped to the roles defined by each service team. When an employee is transferred or their employment is terminated, the account management tools will automatically revoke the associated account's access to the privileges mapped to their previous role. Part i Customer Responsibility Part 1, 2, 3 Government customers are responsible for managing organizational user accounts by granting access to Product1 based on: a valid access authorization; intended system usage; and other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions using their AD infrastructure. Government users utilize the government AD infrastructure to identify, authenticate, and apply permissions to that user's session. Government users communicate identification/authentication, and the associated permissions to AAD viacertificate-based authentication. For more information on managing user accounts in AD, see the following link: <some_link> Non-government customers can manage organizational user accounts by granting access to Product1 based on: a valid access authorization; intended system usage; and other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link> Product1 Part 1, 2, 3 Product1 Membership in security groups that give access to the system is given only to those in specific roles that require system access. Service team managers are responsible for approving group membership. Service team personnel with the access approver role then review and approve or deny the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time (no more than 24 hours) based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus assigns the service team personnel to eligibilities with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revokes permissions at the end of the specified time period. The managers validate the eligibilities requested and justification provided and grant access once validated. Part j Customer Responsibility Product1 Customers are responsible for reviewing the accounts of their organization's users in compliance with their organizational policies. Product1 allows for customers to manage/review their user accounts via SUE. For more information on managing user accounts in AD, see the following link: <some_link> Non-government customers may manage accounts in Product2 Active Directory via the Suite User Experience (SUE) portal. Customers are responsible for logging into the portal and reviewing the Product1 MT accounts of their users compliant with their organizational policies. Disabling or removing users in the SUE portal revokes access to Product1 MT for the affected users. For more information on managing user accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>Product1 The Product1 service teams review service team administrator accounts at least monthly. Access is based on specific roles and duties to support the operational environments. The foundation is granting elevated access for a limited duration through JIT not to exceed twenty-four (24) hours; and a formal program that monitors account activities enabled by auditing account management actions. This provides ongoing review of accounts and alerts of changes. The objective is a continuous rather than static review of access authorizations and activities. Part k Customer Responsibility If government customers allow the use of group shared customer accounts, they are responsible for terminating group/shared account credentials when individuals leave the group. Non-government customers will terminate credentials using SUE. Product1 Product1 does not allow the use of shared/group service team accounts. Part l Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for aligning account management processes with personnel termination and transfer processes within their organization. Product1 Torus performs a full sync with the Human Resources Information System (HRIS) every 4 hours as well as differential syncs in near-real time. Syncs between these account management tools will revoke account access if the account no longer meets requirements for access; this could be for: inactivity, background check, clearance, EUPI attestation, or when an employee is transferred or their employment is terminated.AC-02(01) Automated System Account Management Support the management of system accounts using [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms].

Government customers are responsible for employing their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure as automated mechanisms to support their organizational user accounts. Certificate-based authentication (CBA) is available to Government users to communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in AD, see the following link: <some_link>.Non-government customers can employ AD as an automated mechanism following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For customers, AAD is employed as an automated mechanism to support their organizational user accounts. For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 IDM is an automated workflow management tool that allows service teams to manage service team administrator and service accounts through account request, approval, creation, modification, and deletion. IDM integrates with Company Online Directory Service (MSODS) to provide identity synchronization, certificate management, service team administrator password resets and service team administrator provisioning from a single interface. Service team managers are responsible for approving requests in IDM. By default, service team AD accounts belong to a security group that only has read access to the production environment. Additionally, if a service team administrator needs elevated privileges to the production environment, they request that access, providing a business justification using Torus and IDM. A service team administrator with the access approver role then reviews and approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus and IDM assign the service team administrator to security groups with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revokes permissions at the end of the specified time period. Falcon, ObjectStore, and SCS also use MyAccess to manage security groups, which are used to gain access to Product2 PaaS services, Source Depot, and configuration files.

\"to manage user accounts in AD, see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers can manage terminating temporary and emergency accounts following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For customers using AAD the process for terminating temporary and emergency accounts will be manual. For more information on managing accounts via the SUE portal, see: <some_link>. Product1 The Company Security Program Policy (MSPP) prohibits the use of temporary and emergency accounts. All local guest accounts are disabled on the system or platform wherever they are located. All account requests follow the standard account management process. For servers that are not domain-joined, the JIT process for granting access to a serverincludes creating and enabling a local account for the duration of access. JIT sessions are task-based and have a default TTL of 4 hours and cannot exceed 24 hours, as documented in AC-2(11). When the life of an authenticator has ended, the service team member must re-request access, gain approval, and generate a new authenticator. Because this access is tied to a specific user’s domain account and requires that the user first authenticate using multifactor authentication, Product1 does not consider this local account to be a temporary account for purposes of this control.

Product1 Product1 performs automated auditing of privileged service team accounts through account management tools, which provide a record of account creation, modification, disabling, and termination of accounts. A notification is sent to the account manager when accounts are changed or managed in any way. Auditing of Product2 Portal accounts is inherited from Product2. Product2 performs auditing of privileged user accounts through an event forwarding tool, which provides a record of all changes made to accounts and notifies the Security Incident Management (SIM) team for any suspicious activities. The account management tools logs account creation, modification, and disablement actions. Monitoring is in place to record all changes to accounts in the Product2 managed domains. Alerts are generated to the workflow ticketing tool if anyone other than the members of the Online Services Security Accounts and Access team or the account management tool service account modifies a user account or security group in the Product2 managed domains.

For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see: <some_link>. Product1 All service team personnel accounts are considered privileged. Service team users are assigned to security roles, which have a defined list of available permissions. By default, service team accounts belong to a security group that only has remote access to read system metadata, and no direct access to the production environment. If a service team user needselevated privileges to the production environment, they must request that access and provide a business justification using Torus and IDM. A service team user with the access approver role then reviews and approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus and IDM assign the service team user to security groups with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revoke permissions at the end of the specified time period. Additionally, for OSI and some IS teams, service team personnel are assigned a role within their service team that corresponds to a security group. Each security group is assigned permissions to correlating environments with just enough access to properly fulfill their tasks. Service team managers are responsible for approving role assignments. Part b Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for tracking and monitoring privileged role assignments, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure.

'to privileged roles will be retained for 90 days; the process for tracking privileged role assignments will be manual. For more information on managing customer account role assignments via the SUE portal, see: <some_link>. Product1 All service team accounts are considered privileged and are tracked and monitored using automated account management tools. For service teams that require Just-In-Time elevated access to the production environment, role assignments are tracked and monitored through Torus and IDM. Part cSee part b. Part d Customer Responsibility Government and non-government customers are responsible for defining and taking required actions when privileged role assignments for customer users are no longer appropriate. Product1 Privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate when Product1 personnel no longer have need of the role to support their current work, or if their employment with Company is terminated. In those cases, Product4 follows the account management workflows to disable the account or revoke access. The system has the capability of terminating a user session on the Terminal Services Gateway (TSG) immediately. The TSGs are managed by Terminal Service Gateway service or inherited from Product2. First, the account associated with the user is disabled, then the session is terminated on the TSG. This prevents the user from further remote access of the system. AC-02(09) Restrictions on Use of Shared and Group Accounts Only permit the use of shared and group accounts that meet [FedRAMP Assignment: organization-defined need with justification statement that explains why such accounts are necessary].

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for defining conditions for establishing shared/group accounts and enforcing those conditions if they choose to establish shared/group accounts. Product1 Product1 does not allow the use of shared/group service team accounts unless the requirement to uniquely attribute user activity to the account is implemented; exceptions may be approved on a case-by-case basis.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for enforcing the appropriate usage and time-based usage restrictions for all customer-controlled accounts. Product1 Product1 requires the use of Torus, an internal Just-In-Time (JIT) access control tool, to access the production environment. Requests for access through Torus must be approved by an eligibility owner and there are limitations to the access granted: • JIT sessions have a default TTL of 4 hours and cannot exceed 24 hours • Sessions are also task-based – all requests must include a justification and grant a restricted set of permissions that are scoped to the requested task • The management forest for Torus is isolated from, and does not trust, the management forests of other service teams, further protecting access control mechanisms from compromise This process can be circumvented only in the event of an emergency through the use of a \"breakglass\" account. There are very few of these accounts. Use of one creates a Sev 1 alert to the incident response team and causes the breakglass account password to be rotated. AC-02(12) Account Monitoring for Atypical Usage (a) Monitor system accounts for [Assignment: organization-defined atypical usage]; and (b) Report atypical usage of system accounts to [FedRAMP Assignment: at a minimum, the ISSO and/or similar role within the organization].AC-02(12) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance: AC-2 (12) (a) Requirement: Required for privileged accounts.

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for defining atypical use and monitoring for that use on their infrastructure. Government customers can additionally review Product1 application logs and analyze them for atypical use. Product1 Product1 uses Vanquish for Near Real Time (NRT) Monitoring for security alerting andmonitoring, which has two high-level methods of alerting. An alert can be configured to fire on a specific event or when multiple events correlate to show an indication of compromise. Atypical use is considered any action that falls outside of the normal baseline activity for each service team as defined by Vanquish. Part b Customer Responsibility Government and non-government customers are responsible for reporting atypical usage to defined organizational personnel. Product1 Product1 follows normal incident reporting procedures if an indication of compromise is detected. These procedures require reporting incidents to the Product1 Security Incident & Response. AC-02(13) Disable Accounts for High-risk Individuals Disable accounts of individuals within [FedRAMP Assignment: one (1) hour] of discovery of [Assignment: organization-defined significant risks].

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for disabling user accounts posing a significant risk. Product1 The Product1 Security Incident & Response (SIR) team is notified by MSIT Corporate Security to monitor users that pose significant risk. Account management tools synchronize with the Human Resources Information System (HRIS). When a service team user is marked as disabled in HRIS, this information propagates to account management tools, which then automatically deactivates the service team domain account. Any accounts associated with the Company user are disabled in real time. AC-03 Access Enforcement Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for enforcing approved authorizations for logical access to the system, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Government users communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. Once permissions are communicated to AAD, AAD is responsible for enforcing those permissions for the users Product1 session. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in Active Directory, see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers can enforce approved authorizations for logical access to the system following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For customers using AAD, AAD is responsible for enforcing the approved authorizations set by the customer in the SUE portal. For more information on managing customer account privileges via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Product1 service teams enforce approved authorizations for logical access using role-based access control enforced by AD and Product2 Active Directory (AAD). Product1 uses AD to implement role-based access control (RBAC) via the use of AD groups. For the purposes of this control, the term \"security group\" references an AD group which is used to enforce RBAC permissions. Product1 service teams are responsible for managing security groups in the production domain. Product1 has three major account types: service team, customer, and service. Service team accounts are used by service team personnel to manage and administer Product1 Customer accounts are used by customer users to access Product1. Service accounts are used by various services to authenticate to servers and other services.AC-04 Information Flow Enforcement Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies].

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for ensuring that no information with a security impact level greater than moderate is stored, processed, or transmitted via the services provided to them by Product1. Product1 will be accredited to store, process, and transmit up to moderate Impact information as defined by NIST SP 800-60. Non-government customers are responsible for ensuring that information stored, processed, or transmitted via the services provided to them by Product1 MT is appropriate and in compliance with the risk policies of their organization. Customer Lockbox is an optional feature that customers can use for controlling the flow of information in EXO. This feature allows customers to control Company administrators\\' ability to access their content. If in response to a customer support request, a Companyadministrator needs access to customer content, that Company administrator initiates a Just In Time request which is routed to a customer administrator; this is in addition to the normal internal required access approvals. The customer administrator can then approve or deny this request via the customer administrator portal. Note that even if customers choose not to use this tool, Product1 Information Security Policy is to never access customer content unless initiated by a customer request, and access to this data is always restricted to screened personnel with required JIT approvals.

\"systems to operate, blocking all other ports, protocols and connections by default. This includes intra-service communications as well as connections to external information systems. Access Control Lists (ACLs) restrict network communications by source and destination networks, protocols, and port numbers. Product1 manages ACL and other firewall rule changes through the same configuration management processes as code changes, which includes review and approval steps. ACLs are stored in Product1's source code repository, Source Depot. ACL changes are implemented to the networking devices through various tools and APIs, including NetConf and Product2 management APIs. The use of firewall rules and ACLs allows Product1 to control the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems. The use of the RFC process ensures that data flows are authorized and approved. A detailed diagram of the Product1 dataflows, which includes all internal and external information flows, is included in this SSP. Product1 is being tested at a High Impact level to demonstrate compliance with the additional controls, but has not been sponsored for a High ATO at this time.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for preventing encrypted information from bypassing content-checking mechanisms by (one or more): decrypting the information; blocking the flow of the encrypted information; terminating communications sessions attempting to pass encrypted information; organization-defined procedures or methods. Product1 supports customer compliance with M-21-31 and M-22-09. Product1 Product1 prevents encrypted information from bypassing IDS through implementing information flow control by allowing only connections and communication which are necessary to allow systems to operate, blocking all other ports, protocols and connections by default. This includes intra-service communications as well as connections to external information systems. Access Control Lists (ACLs) are the preferred mechanism to restrict network communications by source and destination networks, protocols, and port numbers.ACLs exist at both the host and network level. Product1 manages ACL approvals through the Request For Change (RFC) process (including review and risk acceptance) and the change process, and Product2 implements the approved change. Approved mechanisms to implement networked-based ACLs include: ACLs on routers managed by Product2 and firewall rules. The use of firewall rules and ACLs allows Product1 to control the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems. The use of the RFC process ensures that data flows are authorized and approved. Service teams also employ HostIDS to further monitor for data exfiltration at the host level. NRT is used to alert based on specific security events as well as other indicators of compromise, through Vanquish, such as anomalous behavior and suspicious activity.

Product1 Product1 separates all information flows logically using user session encryption. TLS 1.2 ensures the confidentiality and integrity of each flow; only the intended recipient can decrypt information. Additionally, each Product1 customer is placed in a separate Organizational Unit (OU) within Active Directory. Customer content within Product1 is always tied to the customer's specific OU and Product1 will only grant access to the data if there is a valid ticket from AAD authorizing access to the OU and the specific data. For a detailed discussion of how Product1 separates flows and tenant data, please see: <some_link> <some_link> AC-05 Separation of Duties a.

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for separating duties of their organizational users as necessary, to prevent malevolent activity without collusion in compliance with their organizational policies. Government customers will manage their user accounts in their existing Active Directory infrastructure. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in Active Directory, see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers manage their user accounts in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Service teams define their roles in IDM. Each role contains a list of eligibilities. Eligibilities vary depending on the role that a specified service team personnel will assume within the service team. The separation of duties is documented through eligibilities (roles) assigned to service team administrators in IDM. Each service team identifies roles that, if shared by a single person, would allow for malicious activity without collusion. When such role pairs exist, no individual is allowed to belong to both roles. Account permissions and role access are reviewed as part of the monthly account review process. Additionally, service team administrators are required to request privileged access to the production environment and provide a business justification using Torus and IDM. A different service team administrator with the access approver role then reviews and either approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus and IDM assign the service team administrator the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revoke permissions at the end of the specified time period. Implementing access control using Torus and IDM effectively prevents malevolent activity without collusion, as an individual has to review and approve the requestor's access request and would deny requests that would violate separation of duties requirements.The separation of duties is documented through eligibilities (roles) assigned to service team administrators in account management tools. Part b Product1 The separation of duties is documented through eligibilities (roles) assigned to service team administrators in IdM. Each security group in IdM has access to a specific list of eligibilities that grants specific permissions to accomplish various tasks. In order for an admin to accomplish a task in production, they must request elevation to the eligibility with the proper permissions to accomplish that task. A list of these roles can be made available to the customer upon request. AC-06 Least Privilege Employ the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned organizational tasks.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for employing the concept of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for government customer users (and processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions in compliance with their organizational policies. Government customers will manage their user accounts in their existing Active Directory infrastructure. For information regarding how to manage user account permissions in Active Directory, see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers will manage their user accounts in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing account permissions via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Product1 service teams employ the concept of least privilege, documented in IDM Roles and Eligibilities, allowing only authorized accesses for service team users (and processes acting on behalf of service team users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with business functions and organizational need. Service owners must employ the concept of least privilege for specific duties and information systems in accordance with risk assessments as necessary to adequately mitigate risk to operational assets, individuals, and/or other organizations. Service team administrator permissions and segregation of duties are defined in AC-5. Each service team is responsible for defining least privileged roles within their team. Roles are documented within IDM. Teams use Torus JIT and IDM, by default; service team accounts belong to a security group that only has remote metadata access to the environment for that service team. This does not permit direct environment access, or access to customer content. If a service team administrator needs other privileges to the production environment, they must request that access and provide a business justification using Torus and IDM. A service team administrator with the access approver role then reviews and approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus and IDM assigns the service team administrator to security groups with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revokes permissions at the end of the specified time period. The use of this Just-In-Time permissions model ensures that service team administrators only ever have the least privileges required to accomplish assigned tasks in support of Product1mission and business functions, restricted by elevation level, resource access, and time.

is it implemented? Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for explicitly authorizing access to security functions,as defined by their organization, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Government users communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in AD, see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers can explicitly authorize access to security functions following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For customers using AAD, the customer is responsible for authorizing access to \"tenant administration\" privileges which are used to manage user accounts and system configuration via the SUE portal. For more information on managing account privileges via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Service teams employ the concept of least privilege, allowing only pre-authorized access for service team administrators (and processes acting on behalf of service team administrators) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with business functions and organizational need. Service owners employ the concept of least privilege for specific duties and information systems (including specific ports, protocols, and services) in accordance with risk assessments as necessary to adequately mitigate risk to operational assets, individuals, and/or other organizations. All access to the Product1 system must be explicitly authorized, including the following security related functions: establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and system and security administration. Role owners are responsible for reviewing and approving role assignments, and roles are tailored for different job functions such that personnel only have the minimum access required to perform their duties. For some teams, service team accounts by default belong to a security group that only has user-level operating system access to the production environment for that service team - this does not permit access to customer content. Access to any higher level of permissions must be requested through Torus and IDM and authorized by the on-call approver. Through the use of this just in time model, Product1 explicitly authorizes access to security functions. Part bSee part a. AC-06(02) Non-privileged Access for Nonsecurity Functions Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to [FedRAMP Assignment: all security functions] use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions. AC-06(02) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance: AC-6 (2) Guidance: Examples of security functions include but are not limited to: establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters, system programming, system and security administration, other privileged functions.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for requiring that users of information system accounts/roles with access to government security functions or security-relevant information use non-privileged accounts/roles when accessing other system functions. Governmentcustomers are also responsible for auditing any use of privileged accounts/roles for such functions, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Government users communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in Active Directory see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers can require that non-government customer users of information system accounts/roles with access to security functions or security-relevant information use non-privileged accounts/roles when accessing other system functions. Non-government customers can also audit any use of privileged non-government customer accounts/roles for such functions following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage non-government customer user accounts in AAD via SUE. For customers using AAD, the customer is responsible for authorizing access to \"tenant administration\" privileges which are used to manage user accounts and system configuration via the SUE portal. Customers can elect to create a separate, non-privileged account for their administrative personnel to access other functions of Product1 MT. AAD audits all actions taken by tenant administration accounts; audit logs are retained for 90 days. For more information on managing customer account privileges via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Service teams require all individuals with administrative privileges to use their assigned accounts for performing business and security administrative functions in the production environment. Product1 requires that service team administrators of information system accounts, or roles, with access to security functions or security-relevant information, use non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing other system functions. AC-06(03) Network Access to Privileged Commands Authorize network access to [FedRAMP Assignment: all privileged commands] only for [Assignment: organization-defined compelling operational needs] and document the rationale for such access in the security plan for the system.

Product1 Product1 requires all individuals with administrative privileges to use their assigned accounts for performing business and security administrative functions in the production environment. These administrative functions are identified within IDM for each service team.

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for reviewing user privileges. Product1 Product1 reviews privileged accounts at least annually. Privileges are enforced by IDM and are reviewed by managers on a quarterly basis through assigned tasks in Product2 DevOps or the User Account Review (UAR) tool. Part b Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for reassigning or removing privileges for customer-controlled accounts when appropriate. Product1 Product1 follows the IDM workflows to disable the privileged account or revoke access when Product1 personnel no longer have need of the role to support their current work or if theiremployment with Company is terminated. AC-06(08) Privilege Levels for Code Execution Prevent the following software from executing at higher privilege levels than users executing the software: [FedRAMP Assignment: any software except software explicitly documented].

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for auditing account creation, modification, disabling, and deletion events for their Active Directory infrastructure as these events also pertain to Product1 access. For these events, these customers are responsible for capturing what type of event occurred, when (date and time) the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the event, the outcome (success or failure) of the event, and the identity of any user/subject associated with the event. Customers using Windows servers to support their infrastructure automatically meet this requirement as Windows captures these event details by default. For more information regarding Windows event logging, see: <some_link>. Product1 Product1 includes the execution of privileged functions in the list of events to be audited bythe system. All commands run by all accounts are logged. Non-privileged actions (for example, browsing the public internet, use of email clients, etc.) are not allowed within the production environment. Additionally, some teams use just in time (JIT) tools to allow privileged access to be granted within the production environment. Execution of privileged functions using Torus and IDM is audited. AC-06(10) Prohibit Non-privileged Users from Executing Privileged Functions Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.

Part a Customer Responsibility Exchange Online: Exchange Online is a highly configurable service that allows organizations to control how long data is preserved and when it is deleted. By default, content deleted from Exchange can be restored for 14 days. With single item recovery and mailbox retention, customers can recover items in a mailbox upon inadvertent, malicious, or premature deletion. • Customer Administrators are responsible for configuring retention polices to meet organizational requirements when Exchange Online defaults are not adequate. • Customer Administrators are responsible for configuring retention policies consistent with recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO). • When required, Customer Administrators are responsible for increasing retention periods beyond default values. • Customer Administrators are responsible for setting retention policy locks to make retention policy configurations immutable when required to meet recovery time and recovery point objectives. For more information, see Exchange Online Data Resiliency - Company Service Assurance: <some_link> SharePoint and OneDrive:Versioning: SharePoint and OneDrive have built-in features that help protect customer information. SharePoint versioning retains a minimum of 500 versions of a file by default, files and can be configured to retain more versions if desired. The UI doesn't allow a value of fewer than 100 versions to be set, but it's possible to set the system to store fewer versions using public APIs. For reliability, any value less than 100 isn't recommended and can result in user activity causing inadvertent data loss. For more information about versioning, see Versioning in SharePoint (<some_link>). Files Restore: is the ability to go 'back in time' on any Document Library in SharePoint to any second of time in the last 30 days. This process can be used to recover from ransomware, mass deletions, corruption, or any other event. This feature uses file versions so reducing default versions can reduce the effectiveness of this restore. For more information about the Files Restore feature see: <some_link>. Preservation Hold Library: Files stored in SharePoint or OneDrive sites can be retained by applying retention policy settings. When a document with versioning is subject to retention settings, versions get copied to the Preservation Hold library and exist as a separate item. If a customer suspects their files have been compromised, they can investigate file changes by reviewing the retained copy. Customer Administrators are responsible for configuring retention policies when Preservation Hold Libraries are required. Recycle Bin: Customers are responsible for restoring corrupted files. Customers have 93 days to restore deleted data from the recycle bin. For more information, see SharePoint and OneDrive data resiliency in Company Product1 - Company: <some_link> WProduct1: Customers using WProduct1 are responsible for establishing a process for backing up their data in accordance with their organizational policies. Product1 has protections in place to preserve customer data in the event of data center failure, but customer-initiated modifications, including deletion, of data is not covered by Product1. Product1 Company Product1 workloads, including SharePoint and Exchange, are built on resiliency principles, ensuring data replication across active/active data centers in near-real time. Data utilized for restoration activities leverage the same built-in data resiliency and integrity checks applied to live data. Within Company Product1 production environments, peer replication between Product2 datacenters ensures that there are always multiple live copies of data. Product1 services utilize versioning to ensure redundancy and accuracy of information. Standard images and scripts are used to recover lost servers, and replicated data is used to restore corrupted storage.Only the following services store user-level information: CIA, EOP, EXO, Product3, SIP, ODSP, and IS. Services storing customer data will have separate instances specific to MT and GCC. Exchange Online: In Exchange Online, every mailbox is hosted in Database Availability Groups (DAGs) and replicated to geographically separate datacenters within the same region. Each mailbox database has four copies distributed across datacenters within the DAG: one active copy, two up-to-date copies, and one 7-day lagged copy used in the rare event of catastrophic logical corruption. For more information, see Exchange Online Data Resiliency - Company Service Assurance: <some_link> SharePoint and OneDrive Protection: SharePoint and OneDrive Protection have built-in features that help protect customer information. For SharePoint and OneDrive, files are written simultaneously to a primary and secondary datacenter region. Multiple types of checksums are stored within metadata in a separate location; corresponding files are used to ensure data integrity through all stages of the data lifecycle. • File hash stored in metadata: Hash of the entire file is stored with file metadata to ensure document level data integrity is maintained during all operations • Blob hash stored in metadata: Each blob-item stores a hash of the encrypted content to protect against corruption in underlying Product2 storage. • Data integrity job: Every 14 days, each site is scanned for integrity by listing items in the database and matching those up with listed blobs in Product2 storage. The job reports any blob-references missing storage-blobs and can retrieve those blobs through the Product2 storage soft-delete feature if needed. For more information, see SharePoint and OneDrive data resiliency in Company Product1 - Company: <some_link> Product3: Teams chats are stored within Exchange Online user mailboxes and files are stored in either SharePoint or OneDrive. Company Teams data is protected by the controls and recovery mechanisms available within these services. For more information, see Service resilience in Company Teams - Company ServiceAssurance: <some_link> Product2-leveraged Services: Product1 services leveraging Product2 storage solutions inherit backup capabilities from Product2. For user-level information in Product2 Storage, data is synchronously replicated locally using Locally Redundant Storage (LRS), which provides redundancy equivalent to three copies. In addition, data is asynchronously replicated to a separate datacenter in the zone or to a remote region for accounts which have configured Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS), Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS), or Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS). The backups sent to Product2 Storage are encrypted using Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 compliant AES 256-bit encryption. For information on data integrity, refer to: <some_link> Part b Customer Responsibility Customers are responsible for backing up system-level information relating to their use of WProduct1 Cloud PCs. Product1 All system-level information required for service restoral is securely stored within CorpNet. This is achieved through internal code repository tools, namely Product2 DevOps and Source Depot. Product2 DevOps, which utilizes GIT, provides version control to support secure change management processes. For data integrity, Product2 Storage regularly monitors and verifies data stored using cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs). If data corruption is detected, it's repaired using redundant copies. Product2 DevOps relies on both Product2 Blob Storage and Product2 SQL Database to help protect data during hardware or service failures. Product2 Storage geo-replicates data between two regions in the same geographical location. For Product2 Blob Storage, data is replicated three times within a single region. Data is replicated asynchronously to a second region in the same geographical location. As such, Product1 always maintains the equivalent of six copies of data. The use of multiple copies enables failover to a separate region if there's a major outage or disaster, while also having local redundancy for hardware failures within the region. For Product2 SQL Database storage, daily backups are maintained offsite if there's a regional disaster. To safeguard against accidental data loss, Company employs point-in-time backups for both blobs stored in Product2 Blob Storage and databases within Product2 SQL Database. Eachstorage account maintains a separate copy of all blobs, with changes being appended to the existing data. These backups are immutable, eliminating the need to rewrite any existing storage during backup procedures. Product2 SQL Database includes standard backup features, which are utilized by Product2 DevOps. Data is retained for 28 days, with these backups also being replicated in a paired region to facilitate recovery during a regional outage. For more information, see: <some_link>. Part c Product1 All system documentation is securely stored within CorpNet. Use of Product2 IaaS/PaaS services is inherited from Product2. Product1 maintains backups of system documentation, including security-related and privacy-related documentation, through SharePoint or within Product2 DevOps. SharePoint uses versioning and is replicated in near real-time. SharePoint and OneDrive Protection: SharePoint and OneDrive Protection have built-in features that help protect system documentation. • Versioning: Retains a minimum of 500 versions of a file by default and can be configured to retain more, if system documentation is corrupted, a previous version of the file can be recovered. • Files Restore: is the ability to go 'back in time' on any Document Library in SharePoint to any second of time in the last 30 days. This process can be used to recover from ransomware, mass deletions, corruption, or any other event. For more information about the Files Restore feature see: <some_link>. • Recycle bin: If system documentation is inadvertently deleted, the recycle bin will store data for 93 days before permanent deletion. After the 93-day recycle pipeline is complete, deletion takes place independently for Metadata and for Blob Storage. Metadata is removed immediately from the database, which makes the content unreadable unless the metadata is restored from backup. SharePoint maintains 14 days-worth of backups of metadata. These backups are taken locally in near real time and then pushed to storage in redundant Product2 Storage containers on a 5-10-minute schedule. • File hash stored in metadata: Hash of the entire file is stored with file metadata to ensure document level data integrity is maintained during all operations • Blob hash stored in metadata: Each blob-item stores a hash of the encrypted content to protect against corruption in underlying Product2 storage. • Data integrity job: Every 14 days, each site is scanned for integrity by listing items in thedatabase and matching those up with listed blobs in Product2 storage. The job reports any blob-references missing storage-blobs and can retrieve those blobs through the Product2 storage soft-delete feature if needed.

Part d Customer Responsibility WProduct1 customers are responsible for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of customer-controlled backup data. Product1 Product1 configures Product2 services appropriately to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup or versioning data. Use of Product2 services inherited from Product2.Product1 protects the confidentiality and integrity of all customer information through the use of Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant TLS 1.2/1.3 protocols and AES 256-bit encryption. In instances where information is uploaded to Product2 Storage, data is automatically encrypted. As part of the drive to ensure that Company is only using cryptographically secure protocol versions, all teams within Product1 are provided guidance to deprecate older protocols and ciphers. Service Teams are only allowed to leverage TLS 1.2/1.3 and higher protocols for both incoming and outgoing connections. Product1 leverages Key Performance Indicator (KPI) alerting system to ensure service teams are only leveraging TLS 1.2/1.3 and higher protocols. The KPIs are alerted to Product1 service and leadership teams for actions.

Customer Responsibility Customers are responsible for utilizing features of Product1 to restore any data that has been lost or corrupted. Customers are also responsible for periodic testing and validation of recovery procedures. Product1 Company Product1 workloads, including SharePoint and Exchange, are built on resiliency principles, ensuring data replication across active/active data centers in near-real time. Data utilized for restoration activities leverage the same built-in data resiliency and integrity checks applied to live data. Within Company Product1 production environments, peer replication between Product2 datacenters ensures that there are always multiple live copies of data. Standard images and scripts are used to recover lost servers, and replicated data is used to restore corrupted storage. Exchange Online: In Exchange Online, every mailbox is hosted in Database Availability Groups (DAGs) and replicated to geographically separate datacenters within the same region. Each mailbox database has four copies distributed across datacenters within the DAG: one active copy, two up-to-date copies, and one 7-day lagged copy used in the rare event of catastrophic logical corruption. Log File Checks: All transaction log files generated by an Exchange database undergo several forms of consistency checks. When a log file is created, the first thing done is a bit pattern is written and then a series of log writes is performed. This structure enables Exchange Online to execute a series of checks (lost flush, CRC, and other checks) to validate each log file as it is written, and again as it\\'s replicated. Resilient File System: To help prevent corruption from occurring at the file system level, Exchange Online is being deployed on Resilient File System (ReFS) partitions to provide improved recovery capabilities. ReFS is a file system that is designed to be more resilient against data corruption thereby maximizing data availability and integrity. Specifically, ReFS brings improvements in the way that metadata is updated which offers better protection for data and reduces data corruption cases. It also uses checksums to verify the integrity of file data and metadata ensuring that data corruption is easily found and repaired. For more information, see Exchange Online Data Resiliency - Company Service Assurance: <some_link> SharePoint and OneDrive Protection:SharePoint and OneDrive Protection have built-in features that help protect customer information. For SharePoint and OneDrive, files are written simultaneously to a primary and secondary datacenter region. Multiple types of checksums are stored within metadata in a separate location; corresponding files are used to ensure data integrity through all stages of the data lifecycle. • File hash stored in metadata: Hash of the entire file is stored with file metadata to ensure document level data integrity is maintained during all operations • Blob hash stored in metadata: Each blob-item stores a hash of the encrypted content to protect against corruption in underlying Product2 storage. • Data integrity job: Every 14 days, each site is scanned for integrity by listing items in the database and matching those up with listed blobs in Product2 storage. The job reports any blob-references missing storage-blobs and can retrieve those blobs through the Product2 storage soft-delete feature if needed. For more information, see SharePoint and OneDrive data resiliency in Company Product1 - Company: <some_link> Product3: Teams chats are stored within Exchange Online user mailboxes and files are stored in either SharePoint or OneDrive. Company Teams data is protected by the controls and recovery mechanisms available within these services. For more information, see Service resilience in Company Teams - Company Service Assurance: <some_link> System Data & System Documentation: Company ensures that backups of Company Product1 system documentation and system data needed for service restoration are securely kept within CorpNet. This is achieved through SharePoint\\'s inherent data resilience capabilities and internal code repository tools, namely Product2 DevOps and Source Depot. For data integrity, Product2 Storage regularly monitors and verifies data stored using cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs). If data corruption is detected, it\\'s repaired using redundant copies. Product2 Storage also calculates checksums on all network traffic to detect corruption of data packets when storing or retrieving data. CRC checks are performed prior to replication of data as well as periodically - once a month for HDDs, twice a month for SSDs. CRC calculations are tested against values stored in metadata to ensure data integrity within Product2 storage. For information on data integrity and Product2 DevOps refer to: Data redundancy - Product2 Storage <some_link>Data protection overview - Product2 DevOps Services <some_link> For additional details on how Product2 further protects Product1 data within Product2 storage using data-at-rest protections, see Product2\\'s SSP SC-28.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for uniquely identifying and authenticating their organizational users via their Active Directory infrastructure. When a user of an organization attempts to access Product1, the user is redirected to a login page. The user provides their credentials and a login request is created backed by a X.509 certificate and authenticated by AAD. Customers are responsible for enforcing organizationally appropriate identification and authentication requirements including the use of unique identifiers.For more information on Active Directory object naming, see: <some_link>. Non-government customers inherit these controls from AAD. When users enter their username at the Product1 MT hosted login screen, AAD matches the user\\'s domain to the appropriate Active Directory Organizational Unit and attempts to establish a secure session with the user\\'s client. Once the session is established, AAD validates the user\\'s authenticators and issues the user a SAML ticket containing information about the user\\'s unique identity and group membership. Customer administrators use the SUE administration portal to set identification and authentication requirements for their organization. AAD enforces unique identifiers for these customers. For more information on Active Directory object naming, see: <some_link>. Product1 Product1 uses Product2 Active Directory (AAD) for identifying, Torus for authenticating access for Company users in the environment. Product1 personnel accessing Product1 are uniquely identified by their AD or AAD username and authenticate using FIPS 140-2 Validated YubiKey 5 (#3914) and FIPS 140-2 Compliant YubiKey 4 (#3517) or approved FIPS 140-2 compliant TPM modules.

Access to the Product1 production environment using the YubiKey/TPM module solution is protected from replay attacks by the built-in Kerberos functionality of Active Directory (AD). In Kerberos authentication the \"authenticator\" sent by the client contains additional data, such as an encrypted IP list, the client\\'s timestamp, and the ticket lifetime. If a packet is replayed, the timestamp is checked. If the timestamp is earlier than or the same as a previous authenticator, the packet is rejected.

Customer Responsibility Government Customers are required to ensure their information systems uniquely identify and authenticate approved device types prior to establishing a connection with Product1. Non-Government Customers may not be required to provide a list of approved devices prior to establishing a connection with Product1 MT. Non-Government customers should implement industry best practices to determine connection requirements appropriate for the risk tolerances of their system and information. Product1 Product1 uses Active Directory (AD) to uniquely identify and authenticate all devices within the Product1 boundary before establishing a network connection. All Product1 physical servers are joined to an AD domain when deployed. Active Directory Forest members are uniquely identified by Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) with device authentication performed using Kerberos, which is a part of the Windows networking protocols. Virtual machines are identified by the virtual machine deployment ID assigned by Product2 and authenticated via TSL certificates managed as part of the Product2 provisioning process. When establishing a Company Product2 subscription, a subscription ID is created. The Fabric Controller (FC), which manages all VMs in Company Product2, uses this subscription ID to tie VMs to particular subscriptions. For more information about the Fabric Controller see the Product2 SSP. For teams managed by PilotFish, an identity certificate is distributed to every machine on a PilotFish cluster. Each identity certificate contains a unique identifier (machine name), the environment, and machine function (server role).IA-07 Cryptographic Module Authentication Implement mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meet the requirements of applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines for such authentication.

Customer Responsibility Government customers do not have access to request cryptographic certificates from Product1. If they require cryptographic certificates, they must follow their organizational procedures to procure certificates from a valid certificate authority. Product1 Product1 implements FIPS 140-2 encryption mechanisms on all communications between partners and between customers using cryptographic certificates issued by CertDojo which are anchored to the Company Root Certificate Authority. In this implementation, the Company Root Certificate Authority is the cryptographic module for Product1. In order to request a cryptographic certificate, an Product1 service team administrator must be authenticated to the MSIT managed corporate network. The Product1 service team administrator navigates to the internal Company site <http://ssladmin> to request a certificate. The request is routed to the administrator's manager for approval. Once the certificate is issued, the administrator usestwo factor authentication to access Product1 servers to install the certificate. This process meets the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for authentication to a cryptographic module.

Customer Responsibility Product1 government customers are responsible for determining users who have access to their information system. Thus, the responsibility is incumbent upon the customer to uniquely identify and authenticate non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users) who should have system access. The government customer can invite guests and non-organizational users to SPO, Product3, but the guest must be authorized/admitted to the session by the credentialed government customer user for Product3. It is the responsibility of the government customer to follow theirown Rules of Behavior and policies around inviting guests to their systems. Product1 Product1 does not allow any non-organizational users to authenticate to production systems. Government customer users are considered organizational and are covered via IA-2. If government customers decide to allow access to non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of a non-organizational user), they must ensure that such users or processes are uniquely identified and authenticated using credentials that meet or exceed the set of minimum federal government-wide technical, security, privacy, and organizational requirements.

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for ensuring that customer users are using information systems running anti-malware software to access Product1. Product1 The use of anti-malware software is a principal mechanism for protection of Product1 assets from malicious software. The software detects and prevents the introduction of computer viruses, malware, rootkits, worms, and other malicious software onto the service systems. Anti-malware software provides both preventive and detective control over malicious software. System Center Endpoint Protection (SCEP), Windows Defender, Forefront Endpoint Protection (FEP) or Company Endpoint Protection (MEP) is installed as part of the initial build on all systems. Additionally, IP scans and quarantines in real time all email and email attachments both entering and leaving the system for viruses and other malware. Part b Product1 Each anti-malware package tracks the version of the software and what signatures are running. The automatic download and application of signature updates when available from the vendor\\'s virus definition site is centrally managed by the appropriate anti-malware tool for each service team in accordance with the team\\'s defined change management processes. EXO applies Safe Deployment Practices (SDP) to Defender signatures after a malformed signature update caused a high severity incident. Signature updates follow a ringed deployment on a weekly cadence, but the SDP process introduces a slight delay in these signatures reaching the production environment. Testing signature updates in preproduction environments help ensure stability of the information system, but also contributes to a signature update interval of approximately 15 days.

'the appropriate anti-malware tool on each endpoint for each service team: • Periodic scans of the file system (at least weekly) • Real-time scans of files as they are downloaded, opened, or executed Anti-malware tools detect files determined to be malicious and send alerts to Product1 administrators, which triggers the incident response process. PDRS, Product3, ObjectStore, Product4 for Web: PilotFish utilizes real-time scanning of files as they are downloaded, opened, or executed. If the scanning tool is disabled, a Sev 1 alert is generated. PilotFish also monitors for changes to its desired state; deviations from this state will automatically mark the host as unhealthy, remove it from the network, and subsequently tear it down and rebuild. Anti-malware tools detect files determined to be malicious and send alerts to Product1 administrators, which triggers the incident response process. Part 2 When anti-malware tools detect malware in a real-time scan, they block it and an alert is generated and sent to Product1 service team personnel, Product1 Security, and/or Product2 OSSC. When anti-malware tools detect malware in a periodic scan, the malware is quarantined. The receiving personnel initiate the Incident Response process. Incidents are tracked and resolved, and postmortem analysis is performed, as discussed in the Product1 Security Incident Response Plan. Acceptable output from MpPreference includes a setting of \\'0\\' or \\'2,\\' both of which will quarantine detected threats and initiate the Incident Response process. Part d Product1 When anti-malware tools detect malware, they block the malware and an alert is generated and sent to Product1 service team personnel, Product1 Security, and/or Product2. The receiving personnel initiate the Incident Response process. Incidents are tracked and resolved, and postmortem analysis is performed, as discussed in the Product1 Security Incident Response Plan.SI-04 System Monitoring a. Monitor the system to detect: 1.

Part a Product1 Part 1 Service teams have deployed Near Real Time monitoring solutions that generate all real-time alerts and audit logs from both SCOM and the repository. All the service team-specific monitoring requirements beyond the base set defined in Product1 Security Auditing SOP for Product1 are integrated into a SCOM pack. In addition, service teams upload their logs to a repository service, where they are aggregated and processed. The uploader service generates reports using automated security alerting tools. These automated security alerting tools assist in identifying normal usage of the system and deviations from that normal range. Additionally, they examine records to confirm that the system is functioning in an optimal, resilient, and secure state. Unusual activity is flagged and alerted in Near Real Time. The repository also aggregates logs for further review. Any log event that indicates a potential security violation must be immediately brought to the attention of Product1 Security. Teams using PilotFish use K9, a tool that collects security logs and performs real-time analysis, as well as archiving them to a repository service for forensic analysis. Unusual activity will generate alerts and the PilotFish team coordinates with the appropriate service team for any required follow-ups or investigations. Service teams will work with the Product1 SIR team to address all security incidents.Part 2 Local connections are disallowed by policy within Product4. No personnel have local access. Product2 performs network monitoring and detection of unauthorized connections in accordance with their security policy. Monitoring is also inherited for services using inherited compute from Product2. Remote authentication failures are logged and stored within a repository service. For further information, please see AC-17 and AC-7. Part b Product1 Audit logs are uploaded to repository and reports are generated using automated security alerting tools. These automated security alerting tools assist in identifying normal usage of the system and deviations from that normal range. The automated security alerting tools use heuristics to identify unauthorized use of the operating system. Unusual activity is flagged and alerted in near real time and a repository aggregates logs for further review. Any log event that indicates a potential security violation must be immediately brought to the attention of Product1 Security. For services using inherited compute via Product2, this control is inherited from Product2. For teams using PilotFish, audit logs are uploaded to a repository service and reports are generated using PilotFish/K-9. PilotFish/K-9 assists in identifying normal usage of the system and deviations from that normal range. PilotFish/K-9 uses heuristics to identify unauthorized use of the operating system. Unusual activity is flagged for further review. Any log event that indicates a potential security violation must be immediately brought to the attention of Product1 Security. Part c Product1 Part 1 All servers act as monitoring devices and are configured to log all security-relevant events. Product1 monitors and alerts in Near Real Time for all hosts in the environment. Suspicious events generate alarms and notifications to service team staff and appropriate contingent staff. Logs are aggregated in a repository service and reports are generated using the automated security alerting tools. For teams using PilotFish, all servers act as monitoring devices and are configured to log all security-relevant events. Product1 monitors all hosts in the environment. Suspicious eventsgenerate alarms and notifications to service team staff and appropriate contingent staff. Logs are aggregated in a repository service and reports are generated using PilotFish/K-9. Part 2 All servers are configured to log all exceptions and security-relevant events. Additionally, Product1 monitors all devices and has those logs exported to a centralized system for aggregated alerting/monitoring. Therefore, Product1 has determined that there is no need for ad-hoc deployment of monitoring devices as documented in \"Ad-hoc Monitoring Devices Decision Log (SI-4)\". Part d Product1 Audit logs are uploaded to a repository service from all servers in the Product1 environment. Each service team receives near real-time alerting on security events through various alerting tools and reports can be generated from the alerts and from the uploader service. Each team is responsible for reviewing and analyzing the alerts for indications of inappropriate or unusual activity, including indications of compromise. Findings are reported and escalated using standard security incident management channels: Tickets are opened to track these security incidents using ticket tracking software and the Product1 Security team is engaged when appropriate. All servers upload logs to a repository service for aggregation and analysis. Handling and access to event and anomaly data is detailed in the AU family of controls. Part e Product1 Product1 Security notifies service teams if a change in the level of monitoring is necessary due to indications of increased risk, and service teams adjust monitoring accordingly. Servers are configured to increase logging parameters in response to an indication of increased risk, and the automated security alerting tools heuristics are tailored to look for specific threats, in conjunction with any alerts received via NRT Security Monitoring, based on the nature of the risk to organizational operations and assets. Part f Product1 Product1 Security, in consultation with Corporate External Legal Affairs (CELA), has defined aset of log events and alerts that meet federal regulatory requirements for incident management and investigation. This structure is intended to support identification of known suspicious activity and to support the investigation of misuse and abuse of Product1 services. To fully comply with applicable regulations, the service teams follow defined requirements for event collection and notification processes. These requirements are contained in the Product1 Security and PilotFish/K-9 onboarding document. Part g Product1 All servers upload logs to a repository service for aggregation and analysis. Reports are generated from this data using NRT Security Monitoring and the automated security alerting tools as described AU-6 and AU-7. These reports are available daily and as needed. For teams using PilotFish, all servers upload logs to a repository service for aggregation and analysis. Reports are generated from this data using PilotFish/K-9 as described AU-6 and AU-7. These reports are available daily and as needed.

Part a Product1 Product2 monitors for unusual traffic patterns using OneDDOS. In addition, service teams monitor for denial of service attacks by monitoring the following key health metrics: CPU usage, network connections, disk input/output operations per second (IOPS), and disk space usage. Product1 service teams also monitor and review web server (e.g. IIS) logs and other application logs (as applicable) for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions. Any unapproved connections detected through auditing or alerting will be triaged using security incident response processes. Part b Product1 See Part (a). SI-04(05) System-generated Alerts Alert [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] when the following system-generated indications of compromise or potential compromise occur: [Assignment: organization-defined compromise indicators].

Product1 Product1 Security has defined requirements for active monitoring. Service teams configure active monitoring tools in accordance with these requirements. Active monitoring tools include Near Real Time Security Monitoring (NRT Security Monitoring), System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) and the automated security alerting tools, which are configured to provide real time alerts to Service Team Operations personnel in situations that require immediate action. Service Team Operations personnel act as the designee of the SCA / ISSO. For teams using PilotFish use K-9 which is configured to provide real time alerts to Service Team Operations personnel in situations that require immediate action. The list of events being monitored is stored on each respective team's SharePoint site.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for making provisions so that customer-defined encrypted communications traffic are visible to information system monitoring tools. Product1 This control does not apply to Product1. Product1 does not inspect or monitor customer traffic. By default, Product1 is unaware of what data is outbound from the environment by thecustomer. In the event of customer data spillage, upon customer request, Product1 may assist with the incident including accessing customer data according to the Product1 Incident Response Policies and Procedures. SI-04(1 1) Analyze Communications Traffic Anomalies Analyze outbound communications traffic at the external interfaces to the system and selected [Assignment: organization-defined interior points within the system] to discover anomalies.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for analyzing communications traffic anomalies for customer-deployed resources, including an analysis of outbound communications traffic at the external boundary and at customer-defined interior points within the system to discover anomalies.Product1 Product1 monitors for and protects against mining of system data and customer content. All access to Product1 occurs through remote access to the TSG or Product2 managed Terminal Services Gateways (TSG). The Product1 Security team monitors remote access for any large data exfiltration through the TSGs. Product1 Security uses a robust security monitoring and alerting tool to ingest logs from hosts and other networking infrastructure in the environment, compare these logs to an extensive ruleset, and alert Security personnel when a match is found between the two. Service teams also employ HostIDS to further monitor for data exfiltration at the host level. NRT is used to alert based on specific security events as well as other indicators of compromise such as anomalous behavior and suspicious activity. In addition, access to the Product1 system is limited to a small number of Product1 cleared service team administrators. Product1 cleared service team administrators have taken role-based access training, security awareness training and have been background screened. If Product1 becomes aware of any unlawful access to any customer content stored in its equipment or in its facilities, or unauthorized access to such equipment or facilities resulting in loss, disclosure, or alteration of customer content (each considered a security incident), Product1 will: (a) notify the affected customer of the security incident; (b) investigate the security incident and provide the customer with information about the security incident; and (c) take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the security incident. In the event of customer data spillage, upon customer request, Product1 may assist with the incident including accessing customer data according to the Product1 Incident Response Policies and Procedures.

Customer Responsibility Customers are responsible for monitoring and alerting security personnel of any unusual activities for systems that connect to Product1. Product1 Product1 automated security monitoring and alerting tools generate real time alerts and audit logs from both SCOM and the repository service. These automated tools perform analysis and trigger emails to Service Team Engineering groups when a specified threshold has been reached or event has occurred. Upon receipt, Service Team Engineering personnel use a ticketing tool and create a bug to analyze and track the issue and follow incident response procedures.\", {'id': 13})]\n"

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for developing and maintaining appropriate Access Control policies and procedures that govern access management activities for their organization and users. Customers are responsible for setting access control policies that support the confidentiality of stored content. For example, sensitive documents stored in SharePoint should not be shared outside of the Product1 boundary, and sensitive email should be sent using encryption. Product1 Part 1 The \"Product1 Information Security Policy\" provides the overarching security guidance for Product1. This document addresses the purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, compliance requirements, and required coordination among the various Company organizations providing some level of support for the security of Product1. Policies are distributed via SharePoint to personnel responsible for implementing access control policies and procedures.Part 2 Standards and procedures to facilitate execution of the Product1 Information Security Policy are documented in the Product1 SOPs and service team-specific SOPs. These standards and procedures act as adjuncts to the security policy and provide implementation level requirements and details to carry out specific operational tasks. A detailed mapping of Product1 SOPs are distributed via SharePoint to roles providing support for Product1 security.

Part a Customer Responsibility All customers, including government and non-government customers, are responsible for identifying the account types for their organization in compliance with their organizational policies. Customers will configure their account types in their existing Active Directory infrastructure or they will configure account types in AAD. Non-government customers will configure account types in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer account types via the Product1 Admin Center, see the following link: Guest access to Product3 meetings, if enabled, allows anyone with a meeting invite to access the meeting lobby; this method of guest access is considered session access as no account is assigned to the guest user. The meeting organizer is responsible for establishing the identity of lobby participants before granting them access to the meeting. Government customers are responsible for disabling guest access to Product3 meetings to remain compliant with FedRAMP standards as advised in \"Product1 Complementary Federal User Entity Control\". Non-government customers are responsible for determining if the use of guest access to Product3 meetings should be allowed for their organization. This setting can be configured by government and non-government customers. SharePoint Online guest invitations allow external users to access an organization\\'s SharePoint Online site(s). Government and non-government customers are responsible for determining if the use of guest access to SharePoint Online, as an account type, should be allowed for their organization. Government customers are responsible for disabling guest access to SharePoint Online to remain compliant with FedRAMP standards. The setting to allow or disallow guest access to SharePoint Online can be configured by government and non-government customers. For more information, see the Company Product1 Solution and Architecture Center: Product1 Product1 accounts are only provided to Company personnel supporting Product1 services. Accounts with permissions to internal assets and resources are not provisioned to customers. Company personnel are assigned unique corporate network (CorpNet) AD accounts as part of a standard onboarding to Company. These CorpNet accounts, known as user alias\\', do not have access to any production environment by default.For personnel supporting Product1 services, service team accounts are used to manage and administer Product1. Service team accounts tie to the user\\'s CorpNet account. This alias is consistent across all of the user\\'s accounts in all Company domains, including Product1. CorpNet and Product1 access are provisioned and managed using separate account management tools. Below are the different account types that Product1 utilizes: Standard Access All personnel with standard access to Product1 are granted system metadata read access used for regular troubleshooting, release management, and other maintenance and monitoring activities. Standard access provides permissions to key Product1 tools, services, SharePoint sites, documentation, and a variety of dashboards. Standard access does not provide access into the production environment. A user with standard access may have the need to review service-specific logs within Product1 to identify and diagnose issues. Any additional permissions above standard access requires elevation of access via Torus JIT, described below. Elevated Access All personnel must use JIT when interactive elevated access is required in the Product1 production environment. Except in the case of an approved exception as described below, there is no standing or persistent elevated access to the production environment. The primary exception is Break-Glass elevated access, described below. In scenarios where JIT does not yet support management of elevated access, standing access may exist; these gaps in JIT support are identified and tracked as an exception, which requires approval. Software deployment via automated means (i.e., not using an interactive login) does not require interactive login to a resource that is accessed via JIT. In this case, a service team member submits a job (e.g., Pull Request in Product2 DevOps), and another team member reviews, approves, and then the safe deployment system deploys. Elevated Access – Break-Glass Access Product1 maintains Break-Glass accounts with elevated access for use in the scenario that the JIT service is not available. These accounts have persistent elevated access to perform maintenance activities if JIT is unable to provide temporary elevated access. These accounts are carefully managed, only to be used in emergencies, and have notifications associated with their use. Whenever such an account is utilized, a Severity 2 incident ticket is generated that requires the service that owns the resource to investigate and determine whether the access is valid. Service Accounts Non-user, non-interactive service accounts are used to run relevant services. Service accounts are not used for interactive logins. For example, software deployment via automatedmeans does not require interactive login to a resource that would normally be accessed via JIT. In this example, a service team member submits a job, such as a Pull Request in Product2 DevOps, and another team member reviews and approves. Part b Customer Responsibility All customers, including government and non-government customers, are responsible for assigning account managers for the account types identified in part a of this control. Product1 Product1 assigns account managers to each role type using IDM, which include workflows that enforce business rules. Throughout this SSP, these tools are collectively referenced as \"account management tools\". Part c Customer Responsibility All customers, including government and non-government customers, are responsible for establishing conditions for group/role membership for their organization in compliance with their organizational policies. Non-government customers will configure groups in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer groups/roles in AAD via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Service teams establish conditions for group/role membership by defining and enforcing conditions for each group/role in account management tools. In addition, service teams use Torus and IDM to enforce additional, more granular conditions for privilege escalation and approval for interactive sessions. Product1 establishes conditions for group and role membership based on least privilege necessary for a user to perform their assigned duties. Predetermined conditions are established when groups are created. Part d Customer ResponsibilityPart 1, 2, 3 Government and non-government customers are responsible for identifying organizationally authorized users and specifying access privileges for those users using their existing Active Directory (AD) infrastructure.

page_content=\"apply permissions to that user's session. Customers communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. Non-government customers will manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For these customers, AAD is responsible for identifying organizationally authorized users and will enforce the access privileges defined by the customer. For more information on managing customer user identifiers and specifying access privileges in AAD via the SUE portal, see the Product1 Part 1, 2, 3 Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is used to identify and control the access privileges of each service team personnel Service teams define their roles in IDM which contain a list of eligibilities. Eligibilities vary depending on the role that a specified service team personnel will assume within the service team. Privileges are defined in the eligibilities and enforced by Active Directory. By default, these service team accounts initially belong to a security group that has remote system metadata read access, and no direct access to the production environment. If service team personnel need additional access to the production environment, they request that access and provide business justification using Just-In-Time (JIT) tools. Part e Customer Responsibility All customers, including government and non-government customers, are responsible for requiring appropriate approvals for requests to establish organizational accounts in compliance with their organizational policies. Government and non-government customers will manage their accounts in their existing Active Directory infrastructure. Non-government customers will configure account types in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer account types via the Product1 Admin Center, see the following link: <some_link> Product1In order to gain access to the production environment, service team personnel must first request access via the account management tools; access to the production environment is provided via security group membership. Approval to establish the account from the service team's management is required for a service team administrator to be added to the appropriate security group. These approvals are tracked and enforced by account management tools. Part f Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for establishing, activating, modifying, disabling, and removing organizational accounts in accordance with their procedures using their AD infrastructure. Government users utilize the government AD infrastructure to identify, authenticate, and apply permissions to that user's session. Government users communicate identification/authentication, and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. For more information on managing user accounts in Active Directory (AD), see the following link: <some_link> Non-government customers establish, activate, modify, disable, and remove organizational accounts following the same procedures outlined for government customers. Non-government customers manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link> Product1 Account changes are managed through IDM in accordance with Product1 Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) The Product1 Information Security Policy and rules have been defined in account management tools which provide an automated workflow that allows service teams to track account requests, approvals, creations, modifications, and deletions. Service team managers are responsible for approving account lifecycle events in account management tools, ensuring that Product1 establishes, activates, modifies, disables, and removes accounts appropriately. Part g Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for monitoring the use of information system accounts managed by their AD. See AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, and SI-4 for more details about theseresponsibilities. Product1 Product1 monitors the use of information system accounts in accordance with the AU family of security controls. Product1 records the auditable events defined in AU-2 with the content defined in AU-3 and monitors those records in accordance with the control descriptions for AU-6 and SI-4. Part h Customer Responsibility Part 1, 2, 3 Government and non-government customers are responsible for implementing processes to notify customer account managers when accounts are no longer required, when users are terminated or transferred, or when individual information system usage or need-to-know changes. Product1 Part 1, 2, 3 Product1 uses automated workflow account management tools that allow service teams to track the account management process through account request, approval, creation, modification, and deletion. As changes occur, the corresponding account manager is notified of the changes that require their approval. Information system usage and need-to-know are mapped to the roles defined by each service team. When an employee is transferred or their employment is terminated, the account management tools will automatically revoke the associated account's access to the privileges mapped to their previous role. Part i Customer Responsibility Part 1, 2, 3 Government customers are responsible for managing organizational user accounts by granting access to Product1 based on: a valid access authorization; intended system usage; and other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions using their AD infrastructure. Government users utilize the government AD infrastructure to identify, authenticate, and apply permissions to that user's session. Government users communicate identification/authentication, and the associated permissions to AAD viacertificate-based authentication. For more information on managing user accounts in AD, see the following link: <some_link> Non-government customers can manage organizational user accounts by granting access to Product1 based on: a valid access authorization; intended system usage; and other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link> Product1 Part 1, 2, 3 Product1 Membership in security groups that give access to the system is given only to those in specific roles that require system access. Service team managers are responsible for approving group membership. Service team personnel with the access approver role then review and approve or deny the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time (no more than 24 hours) based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus assigns the service team personnel to eligibilities with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revokes permissions at the end of the specified time period. The managers validate the eligibilities requested and justification provided and grant access once validated. Part j Customer Responsibility Product1 Customers are responsible for reviewing the accounts of their organization's users in compliance with their organizational policies. Product1 allows for customers to manage/review their user accounts via SUE. For more information on managing user accounts in AD, see the following link: <some_link> Non-government customers may manage accounts in Product2 Active Directory via the Suite User Experience (SUE) portal. Customers are responsible for logging into the portal and reviewing the Product1 MT accounts of their users compliant with their organizational policies. Disabling or removing users in the SUE portal revokes access to Product1 MT for the affected users. For more information on managing user accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>Product1 The Product1 service teams review service team administrator accounts at least monthly. Access is based on specific roles and duties to support the operational environments. The foundation is granting elevated access for a limited duration through JIT not to exceed twenty-four (24) hours; and a formal program that monitors account activities enabled by auditing account management actions. This provides ongoing review of accounts and alerts of changes. The objective is a continuous rather than static review of access authorizations and activities. Part k Customer Responsibility If government customers allow the use of group shared customer accounts, they are responsible for terminating group/shared account credentials when individuals leave the group. Non-government customers will terminate credentials using SUE. Product1 Product1 does not allow the use of shared/group service team accounts. Part l Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for aligning account management processes with personnel termination and transfer processes within their organization. Product1 Torus performs a full sync with the Human Resources Information System (HRIS) every 4 hours as well as differential syncs in near-real time. Syncs between these account management tools will revoke account access if the account no longer meets requirements for access; this could be for: inactivity, background check, clearance, EUPI attestation, or when an employee is transferred or their employment is terminated.AC-02(01) Automated System Account Management Support the management of system accounts using [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms].

Government customers are responsible for employing their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure as automated mechanisms to support their organizational user accounts. Certificate-based authentication (CBA) is available to Government users to communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in AD, see the following link: <some_link>.Non-government customers can employ AD as an automated mechanism following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For customers, AAD is employed as an automated mechanism to support their organizational user accounts. For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 IDM is an automated workflow management tool that allows service teams to manage service team administrator and service accounts through account request, approval, creation, modification, and deletion. IDM integrates with Company Online Directory Service (MSODS) to provide identity synchronization, certificate management, service team administrator password resets and service team administrator provisioning from a single interface. Service team managers are responsible for approving requests in IDM. By default, service team AD accounts belong to a security group that only has read access to the production environment. Additionally, if a service team administrator needs elevated privileges to the production environment, they request that access, providing a business justification using Torus and IDM. A service team administrator with the access approver role then reviews and approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus and IDM assign the service team administrator to security groups with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revokes permissions at the end of the specified time period. Falcon, ObjectStore, and SCS also use MyAccess to manage security groups, which are used to gain access to Product2 PaaS services, Source Depot, and configuration files.

For customers using AAD the process for terminating temporary and emergency accounts will be manual. For more information on managing accounts via the SUE portal, see: <some_link>. Product1 The Company Security Program Policy (MSPP) prohibits the use of temporary and emergency accounts. All local guest accounts are disabled on the system or platform wherever they are located. All account requests follow the standard account management process. For servers that are not domain-joined, the JIT process for granting access to a serverincludes creating and enabling a local account for the duration of access. JIT sessions are task-based and have a default TTL of 4 hours and cannot exceed 24 hours, as documented in AC-2(11). When the life of an authenticator has ended, the service team member must re-request access, gain approval, and generate a new authenticator. Because this access is tied to a specific user’s domain account and requires that the user first authenticate using multifactor authentication, Product1 does not consider this local account to be a temporary account for purposes of this control.

Product1 Product1 performs automated auditing of privileged service team accounts through account management tools, which provide a record of account creation, modification, disabling, and termination of accounts. A notification is sent to the account manager when accounts are changed or managed in any way. Auditing of Product2 Portal accounts is inherited from Product2. Product2 performs auditing of privileged user accounts through an event forwarding tool, which provides a record of all changes made to accounts and notifies the Security Incident Management (SIM) team for any suspicious activities. The account management tools logs account creation, modification, and disablement actions. Monitoring is in place to record all changes to accounts in the Product2 managed domains. Alerts are generated to the workflow ticketing tool if anyone other than the members of the Online Services Security Accounts and Access team or the account management tool service account modifies a user account or security group in the Product2 managed domains.

For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see: <some_link>. Product1 All service team personnel accounts are considered privileged. Service team users are assigned to security roles, which have a defined list of available permissions. By default, service team accounts belong to a security group that only has remote access to read system metadata, and no direct access to the production environment. If a service team user needselevated privileges to the production environment, they must request that access and provide a business justification using Torus and IDM. A service team user with the access approver role then reviews and approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus and IDM assign the service team user to security groups with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revoke permissions at the end of the specified time period. Additionally, for OSI and some IS teams, service team personnel are assigned a role within their service team that corresponds to a security group. Each security group is assigned permissions to correlating environments with just enough access to properly fulfill their tasks. Service team managers are responsible for approving role assignments. Part b Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for tracking and monitoring privileged role assignments, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure.

page_content='to privileged roles will be retained for 90 days; the process for tracking privileged role assignments will be manual. For more information on managing customer account role assignments via the SUE portal, see: <some_link>. Product1 All service team accounts are considered privileged and are tracked and monitored using automated account management tools. For service teams that require Just-In-Time elevated access to the production environment, role assignments are tracked and monitored through Torus and IDM. Part cSee part b. Part d Customer Responsibility Government and non-government customers are responsible for defining and taking required actions when privileged role assignments for customer users are no longer appropriate. Product1 Privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate when Product1 personnel no longer have need of the role to support their current work, or if their employment with Company is terminated. In those cases, Product4 follows the account management workflows to disable the account or revoke access. The system has the capability of terminating a user session on the Terminal Services Gateway (TSG) immediately. The TSGs are managed by Terminal Service Gateway service or inherited from Product2. First, the account associated with the user is disabled, then the session is terminated on the TSG. This prevents the user from further remote access of the system. AC-02(09) Restrictions on Use of Shared and Group Accounts Only permit the use of shared and group accounts that meet [FedRAMP Assignment: organization-defined need with justification statement that explains why such accounts are necessary]. AC-02(09) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance: AC-2 (9) Requirement: Required if shared/group accounts are deployed AC-02(09) Control Summary Information Responsible Role: Customer Administrator, Product1 Security Manager, Product1 Trust Program Manager Parameter AC-02(09): exception-based criteria Implementation Status (check all that apply): ☒ Implemented ☐ Partially implemented ☐ Planned☐ Alternative implementation ☐ Not applicable Control Origination (check all that apply): ☐ Service Provider Corporate ☐ Service Provider System Specific ☐ Service Provider Hybrid (Corporate and System Specific) ☐ Configured by Customer (Customer System Specific) ☐ Provided by Customer (Customer System Specific) ☒ Shared (Service Provider and Customer Responsibility) ☐ Inherited from pre-existing authorization AC-02(09) What is the solution and how is it implemented? Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for defining conditions for establishing shared/group accounts and enforcing those conditions if they choose to establish shared/group accounts. Product1 Product1 does not allow the use of shared/group service team accounts unless the requirement to uniquely attribute user activity to the account is implemented; exceptions may be approved on a case-by-case basis. AC-02(1 1) Usage Conditions Enforce [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances and/or usage conditions] for [Assignment: organization-defined system accounts].

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for enforcing the appropriate usage and time-based usage restrictions for all customer-controlled accounts. Product1 Product1 requires the use of Torus, an internal Just-In-Time (JIT) access control tool, to access the production environment. Requests for access through Torus must be approved by an eligibility owner and there are limitations to the access granted: • JIT sessions have a default TTL of 4 hours and cannot exceed 24 hours • Sessions are also task-based – all requests must include a justification and grant a restricted set of permissions that are scoped to the requested task • The management forest for Torus is isolated from, and does not trust, the management forests of other service teams, further protecting access control mechanisms from compromise This process can be circumvented only in the event of an emergency through the use of a \"breakglass\" account. There are very few of these accounts. Use of one creates a Sev 1 alert to the incident response team and causes the breakglass account password to be rotated. AC-02(12) Account Monitoring for Atypical Usage (a) Monitor system accounts for [Assignment: organization-defined atypical usage]; and (b) Report atypical usage of system accounts to [FedRAMP Assignment: at a minimum, the ISSO and/or similar role within the organization].AC-02(12) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance: AC-2 (12) (a) Requirement: Required for privileged accounts. AC-2 (12) (b) Requirement: Required for privileged accounts.

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for defining atypical use and monitoring for that use on their infrastructure. Government customers can additionally review Product1 application logs and analyze them for atypical use. Product1 Product1 uses Vanquish for Near Real Time (NRT) Monitoring for security alerting andmonitoring, which has two high-level methods of alerting. An alert can be configured to fire on a specific event or when multiple events correlate to show an indication of compromise. Atypical use is considered any action that falls outside of the normal baseline activity for each service team as defined by Vanquish. Part b Customer Responsibility Government and non-government customers are responsible for reporting atypical usage to defined organizational personnel. Product1 Product1 follows normal incident reporting procedures if an indication of compromise is detected. These procedures require reporting incidents to the Product1 Security Incident & Response. AC-02(13) Disable Accounts for High-risk Individuals Disable accounts of individuals within [FedRAMP Assignment: one (1) hour] of discovery of [Assignment: organization-defined significant risks]. AC-02(13) Control Summary Information Responsible Role: Customer Administrator, Product1 Security Manager, Product1 Trust Program Manager Parameter AC-02(13)-1: one (1) hour Parameter AC-02(13)-2: any significant risk Implementation Status (check all that apply): ☒ Implemented ☐ Partially implemented ☐ Planned ☐ Alternative implementation ☐ Not applicable Control Origination (check all that apply): ☐ Service Provider Corporate ☐ Service Provider System Specific ☐ Service Provider Hybrid (Corporate and System Specific) ☐ Configured by Customer (Customer System Specific)☐ Provided by Customer (Customer System Specific) ☒ Shared (Service Provider and Customer Responsibility) ☐ Inherited from pre-existing authorization AC-02(13) What is the solution and how is it implemented? Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for disabling user accounts posing a significant risk. Product1 The Product1 Security Incident & Response (SIR) team is notified by MSIT Corporate Security to monitor users that pose significant risk. Account management tools synchronize with the Human Resources Information System (HRIS). When a service team user is marked as disabled in HRIS, this information propagates to account management tools, which then automatically deactivates the service team domain account. Any accounts associated with the Company user are disabled in real time. AC-03 Access Enforcement Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for enforcing approved authorizations for logical access to the system, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Government users communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. Once permissions are communicated to AAD, AAD is responsible for enforcing those permissions for the users Product1 session. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in Active Directory, see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers can enforce approved authorizations for logical access to the system following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For customers using AAD, AAD is responsible for enforcing the approved authorizations set by the customer in the SUE portal. For more information on managing customer account privileges via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Product1 service teams enforce approved authorizations for logical access using role-based access control enforced by AD and Product2 Active Directory (AAD). Product1 uses AD to implement role-based access control (RBAC) via the use of AD groups. For the purposes of this control, the term \"security group\" references an AD group which is used to enforce RBAC permissions. Product1 service teams are responsible for managing security groups in the production domain. Product1 has three major account types: service team, customer, and service. Service team accounts are used by service team personnel to manage and administer Product1 Customer accounts are used by customer users to access Product1. Service accounts are used by various services to authenticate to servers and other services.AC-04 Information Flow Enforcement Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies].

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for ensuring that no information with a security impact level greater than moderate is stored, processed, or transmitted via the services provided to them by Product1. Product1 will be accredited to store, process, and transmit up to moderate Impact information as defined by NIST SP 800-60. Non-government customers are responsible for ensuring that information stored, processed, or transmitted via the services provided to them by Product1 MT is appropriate and in compliance with the risk policies of their organization. Customer Lockbox is an optional feature that customers can use for controlling the flow of information in EXO. This feature allows customers to control Company administrators\\' ability to access their content. If in response to a customer support request, a Companyadministrator needs access to customer content, that Company administrator initiates a Just In Time request which is routed to a customer administrator; this is in addition to the normal internal required access approvals. The customer administrator can then approve or deny this request via the customer administrator portal. Note that even if customers choose not to use this tool, Product1 Information Security Policy is to never access customer content unless initiated by a customer request, and access to this data is always restricted to screened personnel with required JIT approvals. Customer Lockbox places the technical enforcement of this policy within the customer\\'s direct control. For additional information, see: <some_link>.

This includes intra-service communications as well as connections to external information systems. Access Control Lists (ACLs) restrict network communications by source and destination networks, protocols, and port numbers. Product1 manages ACL and other firewall rule changes through the same configuration management processes as code changes, which includes review and approval steps. ACLs are stored in Product1's source code repository, Source Depot. ACL changes are implemented to the networking devices through various tools and APIs, including NetConf and Product2 management APIs. The use of firewall rules and ACLs allows Product1 to control the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems. The use of the RFC process ensures that data flows are authorized and approved. A detailed diagram of the Product1 dataflows, which includes all internal and external information flows, is included in this SSP. Product1 is being tested at a High Impact level to demonstrate compliance with the additional controls, but has not been sponsored for a High ATO at this time.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for preventing encrypted information from bypassing content-checking mechanisms by (one or more): decrypting the information; blocking the flow of the encrypted information; terminating communications sessions attempting to pass encrypted information; organization-defined procedures or methods. Product1 supports customer compliance with M-21-31 and M-22-09. Product1 Product1 prevents encrypted information from bypassing IDS through implementing information flow control by allowing only connections and communication which are necessary to allow systems to operate, blocking all other ports, protocols and connections by default. This includes intra-service communications as well as connections to external information systems. Access Control Lists (ACLs) are the preferred mechanism to restrict network communications by source and destination networks, protocols, and port numbers.ACLs exist at both the host and network level. Product1 manages ACL approvals through the Request For Change (RFC) process (including review and risk acceptance) and the change process, and Product2 implements the approved change. Approved mechanisms to implement networked-based ACLs include: ACLs on routers managed by Product2 and firewall rules. The use of firewall rules and ACLs allows Product1 to control the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems. The use of the RFC process ensures that data flows are authorized and approved. Service teams also employ HostIDS to further monitor for data exfiltration at the host level. NRT is used to alert based on specific security events as well as other indicators of compromise, through Vanquish, such as anomalous behavior and suspicious activity.

Product1 Product1 separates all information flows logically using user session encryption. TLS 1.2 ensures the confidentiality and integrity of each flow; only the intended recipient can decrypt information. Additionally, each Product1 customer is placed in a separate Organizational Unit (OU) within Active Directory. Customer content within Product1 is always tied to the customer's specific OU and Product1 will only grant access to the data if there is a valid ticket from AAD authorizing access to the OU and the specific data. For a detailed discussion of how Product1 separates flows and tenant data, please see: <some_link> <some_link> AC-05 Separation of Duties a.

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for separating duties of their organizational users as necessary, to prevent malevolent activity without collusion in compliance with their organizational policies. Government customers will manage their user accounts in their existing Active Directory infrastructure. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in Active Directory, see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers manage their user accounts in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing customer accounts via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Service teams define their roles in IDM. Each role contains a list of eligibilities. Eligibilities vary depending on the role that a specified service team personnel will assume within the service team. The separation of duties is documented through eligibilities (roles) assigned to service team administrators in IDM. Each service team identifies roles that, if shared by a single person, would allow for malicious activity without collusion. When such role pairs exist, no individual is allowed to belong to both roles. Account permissions and role access are reviewed as part of the monthly account review process. Additionally, service team administrators are required to request privileged access to the production environment and provide a business justification using Torus and IDM. A different service team administrator with the access approver role then reviews and either approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus and IDM assign the service team administrator the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revoke permissions at the end of the specified time period. Implementing access control using Torus and IDM effectively prevents malevolent activity without collusion, as an individual has to review and approve the requestor's access request and would deny requests that would violate separation of duties requirements.The separation of duties is documented through eligibilities (roles) assigned to service team administrators in account management tools. Part b Product1 The separation of duties is documented through eligibilities (roles) assigned to service team administrators in IdM. Each security group in IdM has access to a specific list of eligibilities that grants specific permissions to accomplish various tasks. In order for an admin to accomplish a task in production, they must request elevation to the eligibility with the proper permissions to accomplish that task. A list of these roles can be made available to the customer upon request.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for employing the concept of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for government customer users (and processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions in compliance with their organizational policies. Government customers will manage their user accounts in their existing Active Directory infrastructure. For information regarding how to manage user account permissions in Active Directory, see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers will manage their user accounts in AAD via SUE. For more information on managing account permissions via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Product1 service teams employ the concept of least privilege, documented in IDM Roles and Eligibilities, allowing only authorized accesses for service team users (and processes acting on behalf of service team users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with business functions and organizational need. Service owners must employ the concept of least privilege for specific duties and information systems in accordance with risk assessments as necessary to adequately mitigate risk to operational assets, individuals, and/or other organizations. Service team administrator permissions and segregation of duties are defined in AC-5. Each service team is responsible for defining least privileged roles within their team. Roles are documented within IDM. Teams use Torus JIT and IDM, by default; service team accounts belong to a security group that only has remote metadata access to the environment for that service team. This does not permit direct environment access, or access to customer content. If a service team administrator needs other privileges to the production environment, they must request that access and provide a business justification using Torus and IDM. A service team administrator with the access approver role then reviews and approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus and IDM assigns the service team administrator to security groups with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revokes permissions at the end of the specified time period. The use of this Just-In-Time permissions model ensures that service team administrators only ever have the least privileges required to accomplish assigned tasks in support of Product1mission and business functions, restricted by elevation level, resource access, and time.

solution and how is it implemented? Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for explicitly authorizing access to security functions,as defined by their organization, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Government users communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in AD, see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers can explicitly authorize access to security functions following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage user accounts in AAD via SUE. For customers using AAD, the customer is responsible for authorizing access to \"tenant administration\" privileges which are used to manage user accounts and system configuration via the SUE portal. For more information on managing account privileges via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Service teams employ the concept of least privilege, allowing only pre-authorized access for service team administrators (and processes acting on behalf of service team administrators) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with business functions and organizational need. Service owners employ the concept of least privilege for specific duties and information systems (including specific ports, protocols, and services) in accordance with risk assessments as necessary to adequately mitigate risk to operational assets, individuals, and/or other organizations. All access to the Product1 system must be explicitly authorized, including the following security related functions: establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and system and security administration. Role owners are responsible for reviewing and approving role assignments, and roles are tailored for different job functions such that personnel only have the minimum access required to perform their duties. For some teams, service team accounts by default belong to a security group that only has user-level operating system access to the production environment for that service team - this does not permit access to customer content. Access to any higher level of permissions must be requested through Torus and IDM and authorized by the on-call approver. Through the use of this just in time model, Product1 explicitly authorizes access to security functions. Part bSee part a. AC-06(02) Non-privileged Access for Nonsecurity Functions Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to [FedRAMP Assignment: all security functions] use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions. AC-06(02) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance: AC-6 (2) Guidance: Examples of security functions include but are not limited to: establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters, system programming, system and security administration, other privileged functions.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for requiring that users of information system accounts/roles with access to government security functions or security-relevant information use non-privileged accounts/roles when accessing other system functions. Governmentcustomers are also responsible for auditing any use of privileged accounts/roles for such functions, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Government users communicate identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via certificate-based authentication. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in Active Directory see the following link: <some_link>. Non-government customers can require that non-government customer users of information system accounts/roles with access to security functions or security-relevant information use non-privileged accounts/roles when accessing other system functions. Non-government customers can also audit any use of privileged non-government customer accounts/roles for such functions following the same procedures outlined for government customers, or they can elect to manage non-government customer user accounts in AAD via SUE. For customers using AAD, the customer is responsible for authorizing access to \"tenant administration\" privileges which are used to manage user accounts and system configuration via the SUE portal. Customers can elect to create a separate, non-privileged account for their administrative personnel to access other functions of Product1 MT. AAD audits all actions taken by tenant administration accounts; audit logs are retained for 90 days. For more information on managing customer account privileges via the SUE portal, see the following link: <some_link>. Product1 Service teams require all individuals with administrative privileges to use their assigned accounts for performing business and security administrative functions in the production environment. Product1 requires that service team administrators of information system accounts, or roles, with access to security functions or security-relevant information, use non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing other system functions. AC-06(03) Network Access to Privileged Commands Authorize network access to [FedRAMP Assignment: all privileged commands] only for [Assignment: organization-defined compelling operational needs] and document the rationale for such access in the security plan for the system.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for enforcing least privilege when authorizing network access to privileged commands. Product1 Product1 requires all individuals with administrative privileges to use their assigned accounts for performing business and security administrative functions in the production environment. These administrative functions are identified within IDM for each service team.

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for reviewing user privileges. Product1 Product1 reviews privileged accounts at least annually. Privileges are enforced by IDM and are reviewed by managers on a quarterly basis through assigned tasks in Product2 DevOps or the User Account Review (UAR) tool. Part b Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for reassigning or removing privileges for customer-controlled accounts when appropriate. Product1 Product1 follows the IDM workflows to disable the privileged account or revoke access when Product1 personnel no longer have need of the role to support their current work or if theiremployment with Company is terminated. AC-06(08) Privilege Levels for Code Execution Prevent the following software from executing at higher privilege levels than users executing the software: [FedRAMP Assignment: any software except software explicitly documented].

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for enforcing software execution privileges on customer-deployed resources. Product1 Software execution at a higher privilege level than users executing the software is not applicable for servers and network devices. Product1 only permits administrator access to server who by default have code execution privileges. Tools are only accessible by Product1administrators; therefore, no read only access is provided. AC-06(09) Log Use of Privileged Functions Log the execution of privileged functions.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for auditing account creation, modification, disabling, and deletion events for their Active Directory infrastructure as these events also pertain to Product1 access. For these events, these customers are responsible for capturing what type of event occurred, when (date and time) the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the event, the outcome (success or failure) of the event, and the identity of any user/subject associated with the event. Customers using Windows servers to support their infrastructure automatically meet this requirement as Windows captures these event details by default. For more information regarding Windows event logging, see: <some_link>. Product1 Product1 includes the execution of privileged functions in the list of events to be audited bythe system. All commands run by all accounts are logged. Non-privileged actions (for example, browsing the public internet, use of email clients, etc.) are not allowed within the production environment. Additionally, some teams use just in time (JIT) tools to allow privileged access to be granted within the production environment. Execution of privileged functions using Torus and IDM is audited. AC-06(10) Prohibit Non-privileged Users from Executing Privileged Functions Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.

Part a Customer Responsibility Exchange Online: Exchange Online is a highly configurable service that allows organizations to control how long data is preserved and when it is deleted. By default, content deleted from Exchange can be restored for 14 days. With single item recovery and mailbox retention, customers can recover items in a mailbox upon inadvertent, malicious, or premature deletion. • Customer Administrators are responsible for configuring retention polices to meet organizational requirements when Exchange Online defaults are not adequate. • Customer Administrators are responsible for configuring retention policies consistent with recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO). • When required, Customer Administrators are responsible for increasing retention periods beyond default values. • Customer Administrators are responsible for setting retention policy locks to make retention policy configurations immutable when required to meet recovery time and recovery point objectives. For more information, see Exchange Online Data Resiliency - Company Service Assurance: <some_link> SharePoint and OneDrive:Versioning: SharePoint and OneDrive have built-in features that help protect customer information. SharePoint versioning retains a minimum of 500 versions of a file by default, files and can be configured to retain more versions if desired. The UI doesn't allow a value of fewer than 100 versions to be set, but it's possible to set the system to store fewer versions using public APIs. For reliability, any value less than 100 isn't recommended and can result in user activity causing inadvertent data loss. For more information about versioning, see Versioning in SharePoint (<some_link>). Files Restore: is the ability to go 'back in time' on any Document Library in SharePoint to any second of time in the last 30 days. This process can be used to recover from ransomware, mass deletions, corruption, or any other event. This feature uses file versions so reducing default versions can reduce the effectiveness of this restore. For more information about the Files Restore feature see: <some_link>. Preservation Hold Library: Files stored in SharePoint or OneDrive sites can be retained by applying retention policy settings. When a document with versioning is subject to retention settings, versions get copied to the Preservation Hold library and exist as a separate item. If a customer suspects their files have been compromised, they can investigate file changes by reviewing the retained copy. Customer Administrators are responsible for configuring retention policies when Preservation Hold Libraries are required. Recycle Bin: Customers are responsible for restoring corrupted files. Customers have 93 days to restore deleted data from the recycle bin. For more information, see SharePoint and OneDrive data resiliency in Company Product1 - Company: <some_link> WProduct1: Customers using WProduct1 are responsible for establishing a process for backing up their data in accordance with their organizational policies. Product1 has protections in place to preserve customer data in the event of data center failure, but customer-initiated modifications, including deletion, of data is not covered by Product1. Product1 Company Product1 workloads, including SharePoint and Exchange, are built on resiliency principles, ensuring data replication across active/active data centers in near-real time. Data utilized for restoration activities leverage the same built-in data resiliency and integrity checks applied to live data. Within Company Product1 production environments, peer replication between Product2 datacenters ensures that there are always multiple live copies of data. Product1 services utilize versioning to ensure redundancy and accuracy of information. Standard images and scripts are used to recover lost servers, and replicated data is used to restore corrupted storage.Only the following services store user-level information: CIA, EOP, EXO, Product3, SIP, ODSP, and IS. Services storing customer data will have separate instances specific to MT and GCC. Exchange Online: In Exchange Online, every mailbox is hosted in Database Availability Groups (DAGs) and replicated to geographically separate datacenters within the same region. Each mailbox database has four copies distributed across datacenters within the DAG: one active copy, two up-to-date copies, and one 7-day lagged copy used in the rare event of catastrophic logical corruption. For more information, see Exchange Online Data Resiliency - Company Service Assurance: <some_link> SharePoint and OneDrive Protection: SharePoint and OneDrive Protection have built-in features that help protect customer information. For SharePoint and OneDrive, files are written simultaneously to a primary and secondary datacenter region. Multiple types of checksums are stored within metadata in a separate location; corresponding files are used to ensure data integrity through all stages of the data lifecycle. • File hash stored in metadata: Hash of the entire file is stored with file metadata to ensure document level data integrity is maintained during all operations • Blob hash stored in metadata: Each blob-item stores a hash of the encrypted content to protect against corruption in underlying Product2 storage. • Data integrity job: Every 14 days, each site is scanned for integrity by listing items in the database and matching those up with listed blobs in Product2 storage. The job reports any blob-references missing storage-blobs and can retrieve those blobs through the Product2 storage soft-delete feature if needed. For more information, see SharePoint and OneDrive data resiliency in Company Product1 - Company: <some_link> Product3: Teams chats are stored within Exchange Online user mailboxes and files are stored in either SharePoint or OneDrive. Company Teams data is protected by the controls and recovery mechanisms available within these services. For more information, see Service resilience in Company Teams - Company ServiceAssurance: <some_link> Product2-leveraged Services: Product1 services leveraging Product2 storage solutions inherit backup capabilities from Product2. For user-level information in Product2 Storage, data is synchronously replicated locally using Locally Redundant Storage (LRS), which provides redundancy equivalent to three copies. In addition, data is asynchronously replicated to a separate datacenter in the zone or to a remote region for accounts which have configured Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS), Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS), or Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS). The backups sent to Product2 Storage are encrypted using Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 compliant AES 256-bit encryption. For information on data integrity, refer to: <some_link> Part b Customer Responsibility Customers are responsible for backing up system-level information relating to their use of WProduct1 Cloud PCs. Product1 All system-level information required for service restoral is securely stored within CorpNet. This is achieved through internal code repository tools, namely Product2 DevOps and Source Depot. Product2 DevOps, which utilizes GIT, provides version control to support secure change management processes. For data integrity, Product2 Storage regularly monitors and verifies data stored using cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs). If data corruption is detected, it's repaired using redundant copies. Product2 DevOps relies on both Product2 Blob Storage and Product2 SQL Database to help protect data during hardware or service failures. Product2 Storage geo-replicates data between two regions in the same geographical location. For Product2 Blob Storage, data is replicated three times within a single region. Data is replicated asynchronously to a second region in the same geographical location. As such, Product1 always maintains the equivalent of six copies of data. The use of multiple copies enables failover to a separate region if there's a major outage or disaster, while also having local redundancy for hardware failures within the region. For Product2 SQL Database storage, daily backups are maintained offsite if there's a regional disaster. To safeguard against accidental data loss, Company employs point-in-time backups for both blobs stored in Product2 Blob Storage and databases within Product2 SQL Database. Eachstorage account maintains a separate copy of all blobs, with changes being appended to the existing data. These backups are immutable, eliminating the need to rewrite any existing storage during backup procedures. Product2 SQL Database includes standard backup features, which are utilized by Product2 DevOps. Data is retained for 28 days, with these backups also being replicated in a paired region to facilitate recovery during a regional outage. For more information, see: <some_link>. Part c Product1 All system documentation is securely stored within CorpNet. Use of Product2 IaaS/PaaS services is inherited from Product2. Product1 maintains backups of system documentation, including security-related and privacy-related documentation, through SharePoint or within Product2 DevOps. SharePoint uses versioning and is replicated in near real-time. SharePoint and OneDrive Protection: SharePoint and OneDrive Protection have built-in features that help protect system documentation. • Versioning: Retains a minimum of 500 versions of a file by default and can be configured to retain more, if system documentation is corrupted, a previous version of the file can be recovered. • Files Restore: is the ability to go 'back in time' on any Document Library in SharePoint to any second of time in the last 30 days. This process can be used to recover from ransomware, mass deletions, corruption, or any other event. For more information about the Files Restore feature see: <some_link>. • Recycle bin: If system documentation is inadvertently deleted, the recycle bin will store data for 93 days before permanent deletion. After the 93-day recycle pipeline is complete, deletion takes place independently for Metadata and for Blob Storage. Metadata is removed immediately from the database, which makes the content unreadable unless the metadata is restored from backup. SharePoint maintains 14 days-worth of backups of metadata. These backups are taken locally in near real time and then pushed to storage in redundant Product2 Storage containers on a 5-10-minute schedule. • File hash stored in metadata: Hash of the entire file is stored with file metadata to ensure document level data integrity is maintained during all operations • Blob hash stored in metadata: Each blob-item stores a hash of the encrypted content to protect against corruption in underlying Product2 storage. • Data integrity job: Every 14 days, each site is scanned for integrity by listing items in thedatabase and matching those up with listed blobs in Product2 storage. The job reports any blob-references missing storage-blobs and can retrieve those blobs through the Product2 storage soft-delete feature if needed.

Part d Customer Responsibility WProduct1 customers are responsible for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of customer-controlled backup data. Product1 Product1 configures Product2 services appropriately to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup or versioning data. Use of Product2 services inherited from Product2.Product1 protects the confidentiality and integrity of all customer information through the use of Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant TLS 1.2/1.3 protocols and AES 256-bit encryption. In instances where information is uploaded to Product2 Storage, data is automatically encrypted. As part of the drive to ensure that Company is only using cryptographically secure protocol versions, all teams within Product1 are provided guidance to deprecate older protocols and ciphers. Service Teams are only allowed to leverage TLS 1.2/1.3 and higher protocols for both incoming and outgoing connections. Product1 leverages Key Performance Indicator (KPI) alerting system to ensure service teams are only leveraging TLS 1.2/1.3 and higher protocols. The KPIs are alerted to Product1 service and leadership teams for actions. For more information on Product2-leveraged infrastructure for integrity and availability of data, see Data redundancy - Product2 Storage: <some_link> For more information on how Product1 protects the availability of customer data, see part a. CP-09(01) Testing for Reliability and Integrity Test backup information [FedRAMP Assignment: at least monthly] to verify media reliability and information integrity.

Customer Responsibility Customers are responsible for utilizing features of Product1 to restore any data that has been lost or corrupted. Customers are also responsible for periodic testing and validation of recovery procedures. Product1 Company Product1 workloads, including SharePoint and Exchange, are built on resiliency principles, ensuring data replication across active/active data centers in near-real time. Data utilized for restoration activities leverage the same built-in data resiliency and integrity checks applied to live data. Within Company Product1 production environments, peer replication between Product2 datacenters ensures that there are always multiple live copies of data. Standard images and scripts are used to recover lost servers, and replicated data is used to restore corrupted storage. Exchange Online: In Exchange Online, every mailbox is hosted in Database Availability Groups (DAGs) and replicated to geographically separate datacenters within the same region. Each mailbox database has four copies distributed across datacenters within the DAG: one active copy, two up-to-date copies, and one 7-day lagged copy used in the rare event of catastrophic logical corruption. Log File Checks: All transaction log files generated by an Exchange database undergo several forms of consistency checks. When a log file is created, the first thing done is a bit pattern is written and then a series of log writes is performed. This structure enables Exchange Online to execute a series of checks (lost flush, CRC, and other checks) to validate each log file as it is written, and again as it\\'s replicated. Resilient File System: To help prevent corruption from occurring at the file system level, Exchange Online is being deployed on Resilient File System (ReFS) partitions to provide improved recovery capabilities. ReFS is a file system that is designed to be more resilient against data corruption thereby maximizing data availability and integrity. Specifically, ReFS brings improvements in the way that metadata is updated which offers better protection for data and reduces data corruption cases. It also uses checksums to verify the integrity of file data and metadata ensuring that data corruption is easily found and repaired. For more information, see Exchange Online Data Resiliency - Company Service Assurance: <some_link> SharePoint and OneDrive Protection:SharePoint and OneDrive Protection have built-in features that help protect customer information. For SharePoint and OneDrive, files are written simultaneously to a primary and secondary datacenter region. Multiple types of checksums are stored within metadata in a separate location; corresponding files are used to ensure data integrity through all stages of the data lifecycle. • File hash stored in metadata: Hash of the entire file is stored with file metadata to ensure document level data integrity is maintained during all operations • Blob hash stored in metadata: Each blob-item stores a hash of the encrypted content to protect against corruption in underlying Product2 storage. • Data integrity job: Every 14 days, each site is scanned for integrity by listing items in the database and matching those up with listed blobs in Product2 storage. The job reports any blob-references missing storage-blobs and can retrieve those blobs through the Product2 storage soft-delete feature if needed. For more information, see SharePoint and OneDrive data resiliency in Company Product1 - Company: <some_link> Product3: Teams chats are stored within Exchange Online user mailboxes and files are stored in either SharePoint or OneDrive. Company Teams data is protected by the controls and recovery mechanisms available within these services. For more information, see Service resilience in Company Teams - Company Service Assurance: <some_link> System Data & System Documentation: Company ensures that backups of Company Product1 system documentation and system data needed for service restoration are securely kept within CorpNet. This is achieved through SharePoint\\'s inherent data resilience capabilities and internal code repository tools, namely Product2 DevOps and Source Depot. For data integrity, Product2 Storage regularly monitors and verifies data stored using cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs). If data corruption is detected, it\\'s repaired using redundant copies. Product2 Storage also calculates checksums on all network traffic to detect corruption of data packets when storing or retrieving data. CRC checks are performed prior to replication of data as well as periodically - once a month for HDDs, twice a month for SSDs. CRC calculations are tested against values stored in metadata to ensure data integrity within Product2 storage. For information on data integrity and Product2 DevOps refer to: Data redundancy - Product2 Storage <some_link>Data protection overview - Product2 DevOps Services <some_link> For additional details on how Product2 further protects Product1 data within Product2 storage using data-at-rest protections, see Product2\\'s SSP SC-28.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for uniquely identifying and authenticating their organizational users via their Active Directory infrastructure. When a user of an organization attempts to access Product1, the user is redirected to a login page. The user provides their credentials and a login request is created backed by a X.509 certificate and authenticated by AAD. Customers are responsible for enforcing organizationally appropriate identification and authentication requirements including the use of unique identifiers.For more information on Active Directory object naming, see: <some_link>. Non-government customers inherit these controls from AAD. When users enter their username at the Product1 MT hosted login screen, AAD matches the user\\'s domain to the appropriate Active Directory Organizational Unit and attempts to establish a secure session with the user\\'s client. Once the session is established, AAD validates the user\\'s authenticators and issues the user a SAML ticket containing information about the user\\'s unique identity and group membership. Customer administrators use the SUE administration portal to set identification and authentication requirements for their organization. AAD enforces unique identifiers for these customers. For more information on Active Directory object naming, see: <some_link>. Product1 Product1 uses Product2 Active Directory (AAD) for identifying, Torus for authenticating access for Company users in the environment. Product1 personnel accessing Product1 are uniquely identified by their AD or AAD username and authenticate using FIPS 140-2 Validated YubiKey 5 (#3914) and FIPS 140-2 Compliant YubiKey 4 (#3517) or approved FIPS 140-2 compliant TPM modules. AD strictly enforces unique identifiers. For more information on Active Directory object naming, see: <some_link>.

All Company users connect to the system via TSGs or Admin consoles as described in AC-17; the TSG or Product2 managed Terminal Services Gateways (TSGs) and Admin consoles require the user to present a certificate bound to the card (something you have) with a PIN (something you know). Access to the Product1 production environment using the YubiKey/TPM module solution is protected from replay attacks by the built-in Kerberos functionality of Active Directory (AD). In Kerberos authentication the \"authenticator\" sent by the client contains additional data, such as an encrypted IP list, the client\\'s timestamp, and the ticket lifetime. If a packet is replayed, the timestamp is checked. If the timestamp is earlier than or the same as a previous authenticator, the packet is rejected.

Customer Responsibility Government Customers are required to ensure their information systems uniquely identify and authenticate approved device types prior to establishing a connection with Product1. Non-Government Customers may not be required to provide a list of approved devices prior to establishing a connection with Product1 MT. Non-Government customers should implement industry best practices to determine connection requirements appropriate for the risk tolerances of their system and information. Product1 Product1 uses Active Directory (AD) to uniquely identify and authenticate all devices within the Product1 boundary before establishing a network connection. All Product1 physical servers are joined to an AD domain when deployed. Active Directory Forest members are uniquely identified by Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) with device authentication performed using Kerberos, which is a part of the Windows networking protocols. Virtual machines are identified by the virtual machine deployment ID assigned by Product2 and authenticated via TSL certificates managed as part of the Product2 provisioning process. When establishing a Company Product2 subscription, a subscription ID is created. The Fabric Controller (FC), which manages all VMs in Company Product2, uses this subscription ID to tie VMs to particular subscriptions. For more information about the Fabric Controller see the Product2 SSP. For teams managed by PilotFish, an identity certificate is distributed to every machine on a PilotFish cluster. Each identity certificate contains a unique identifier (machine name), the environment, and machine function (server role).IA-07 Cryptographic Module Authentication Implement mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meet the requirements of applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines for such authentication.

Customer Responsibility Government customers do not have access to request cryptographic certificates from Product1. If they require cryptographic certificates, they must follow their organizational procedures to procure certificates from a valid certificate authority. Product1 Product1 implements FIPS 140-2 encryption mechanisms on all communications between partners and between customers using cryptographic certificates issued by CertDojo which are anchored to the Company Root Certificate Authority. In this implementation, the Company Root Certificate Authority is the cryptographic module for Product1. In order to request a cryptographic certificate, an Product1 service team administrator must be authenticated to the MSIT managed corporate network. The Product1 service team administrator navigates to the internal Company site <http://ssladmin> to request a certificate. The request is routed to the administrator's manager for approval. Once the certificate is issued, the administrator usestwo factor authentication to access Product1 servers to install the certificate. This process meets the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for authentication to a cryptographic module.

Customer Responsibility Product1 government customers are responsible for determining users who have access to their information system. Thus, the responsibility is incumbent upon the customer to uniquely identify and authenticate non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users) who should have system access. The government customer can invite guests and non-organizational users to SPO, Product3, but the guest must be authorized/admitted to the session by the credentialed government customer user for Product3. It is the responsibility of the government customer to follow theirown Rules of Behavior and policies around inviting guests to their systems. Product1 Product1 does not allow any non-organizational users to authenticate to production systems. Government customer users are considered organizational and are covered via IA-2. If government customers decide to allow access to non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of a non-organizational user), they must ensure that such users or processes are uniquely identified and authenticated using credentials that meet or exceed the set of minimum federal government-wide technical, security, privacy, and organizational requirements.

Part a Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for ensuring that customer users are using information systems running anti-malware software to access Product1. Product1 The use of anti-malware software is a principal mechanism for protection of Product1 assets from malicious software. The software detects and prevents the introduction of computer viruses, malware, rootkits, worms, and other malicious software onto the service systems. Anti-malware software provides both preventive and detective control over malicious software. System Center Endpoint Protection (SCEP), Windows Defender, Forefront Endpoint Protection (FEP) or Company Endpoint Protection (MEP) is installed as part of the initial build on all systems. Additionally, IP scans and quarantines in real time all email and email attachments both entering and leaving the system for viruses and other malware. Part b Product1 Each anti-malware package tracks the version of the software and what signatures are running. The automatic download and application of signature updates when available from the vendor\\'s virus definition site is centrally managed by the appropriate anti-malware tool for each service team in accordance with the team\\'s defined change management processes. EXO applies Safe Deployment Practices (SDP) to Defender signatures after a malformed signature update caused a high severity incident. Signature updates follow a ringed deployment on a weekly cadence, but the SDP process introduces a slight delay in these signatures reaching the production environment. Testing signature updates in preproduction environments help ensure stability of the information system, but also contributes to a signature update interval of approximately 15 days.

page_content='the appropriate anti-malware tool on each endpoint for each service team: • Periodic scans of the file system (at least weekly) • Real-time scans of files as they are downloaded, opened, or executed Anti-malware tools detect files determined to be malicious and send alerts to Product1 administrators, which triggers the incident response process. PDRS, Product3, ObjectStore, Product4 for Web: PilotFish utilizes real-time scanning of files as they are downloaded, opened, or executed. If the scanning tool is disabled, a Sev 1 alert is generated. PilotFish also monitors for changes to its desired state; deviations from this state will automatically mark the host as unhealthy, remove it from the network, and subsequently tear it down and rebuild. Anti-malware tools detect files determined to be malicious and send alerts to Product1 administrators, which triggers the incident response process. Part 2 When anti-malware tools detect malware in a real-time scan, they block it and an alert is generated and sent to Product1 service team personnel, Product1 Security, and/or Product2 OSSC. When anti-malware tools detect malware in a periodic scan, the malware is quarantined. The receiving personnel initiate the Incident Response process. Incidents are tracked and resolved, and postmortem analysis is performed, as discussed in the Product1 Security Incident Response Plan. Acceptable output from MpPreference includes a setting of \\'0\\' or \\'2,\\' both of which will quarantine detected threats and initiate the Incident Response process. Part d Product1 When anti-malware tools detect malware, they block the malware and an alert is generated and sent to Product1 service team personnel, Product1 Security, and/or Product2.

Part a Product1 Part 1 Service teams have deployed Near Real Time monitoring solutions that generate all real-time alerts and audit logs from both SCOM and the repository. All the service team-specific monitoring requirements beyond the base set defined in Product1 Security Auditing SOP for Product1 are integrated into a SCOM pack. In addition, service teams upload their logs to a repository service, where they are aggregated and processed. The uploader service generates reports using automated security alerting tools. These automated security alerting tools assist in identifying normal usage of the system and deviations from that normal range. Additionally, they examine records to confirm that the system is functioning in an optimal, resilient, and secure state. Unusual activity is flagged and alerted in Near Real Time. The repository also aggregates logs for further review. Any log event that indicates a potential security violation must be immediately brought to the attention of Product1 Security. Teams using PilotFish use K9, a tool that collects security logs and performs real-time analysis, as well as archiving them to a repository service for forensic analysis. Unusual activity will generate alerts and the PilotFish team coordinates with the appropriate service team for any required follow-ups or investigations. Service teams will work with the Product1 SIR team to address all security incidents.Part 2 Local connections are disallowed by policy within Product4. No personnel have local access. Product2 performs network monitoring and detection of unauthorized connections in accordance with their security policy. Monitoring is also inherited for services using inherited compute from Product2. Remote authentication failures are logged and stored within a repository service. For further information, please see AC-17 and AC-7. Part b Product1 Audit logs are uploaded to repository and reports are generated using automated security alerting tools. These automated security alerting tools assist in identifying normal usage of the system and deviations from that normal range. The automated security alerting tools use heuristics to identify unauthorized use of the operating system. Unusual activity is flagged and alerted in near real time and a repository aggregates logs for further review. Any log event that indicates a potential security violation must be immediately brought to the attention of Product1 Security. For services using inherited compute via Product2, this control is inherited from Product2. For teams using PilotFish, audit logs are uploaded to a repository service and reports are generated using PilotFish/K-9. PilotFish/K-9 assists in identifying normal usage of the system and deviations from that normal range. PilotFish/K-9 uses heuristics to identify unauthorized use of the operating system. Unusual activity is flagged for further review. Any log event that indicates a potential security violation must be immediately brought to the attention of Product1 Security. Part c Product1 Part 1 All servers act as monitoring devices and are configured to log all security-relevant events. Product1 monitors and alerts in Near Real Time for all hosts in the environment. Suspicious events generate alarms and notifications to service team staff and appropriate contingent staff. Logs are aggregated in a repository service and reports are generated using the automated security alerting tools. For teams using PilotFish, all servers act as monitoring devices and are configured to log all security-relevant events. Product1 monitors all hosts in the environment. Suspicious eventsgenerate alarms and notifications to service team staff and appropriate contingent staff. Logs are aggregated in a repository service and reports are generated using PilotFish/K-9. Part 2 All servers are configured to log all exceptions and security-relevant events. Additionally, Product1 monitors all devices and has those logs exported to a centralized system for aggregated alerting/monitoring. Therefore, Product1 has determined that there is no need for ad-hoc deployment of monitoring devices as documented in \"Ad-hoc Monitoring Devices Decision Log (SI-4)\". Part d Product1 Audit logs are uploaded to a repository service from all servers in the Product1 environment. Each service team receives near real-time alerting on security events through various alerting tools and reports can be generated from the alerts and from the uploader service. Each team is responsible for reviewing and analyzing the alerts for indications of inappropriate or unusual activity, including indications of compromise. Findings are reported and escalated using standard security incident management channels: Tickets are opened to track these security incidents using ticket tracking software and the Product1 Security team is engaged when appropriate. All servers upload logs to a repository service for aggregation and analysis. Handling and access to event and anomaly data is detailed in the AU family of controls. Part e Product1 Product1 Security notifies service teams if a change in the level of monitoring is necessary due to indications of increased risk, and service teams adjust monitoring accordingly. Servers are configured to increase logging parameters in response to an indication of increased risk, and the automated security alerting tools heuristics are tailored to look for specific threats, in conjunction with any alerts received via NRT Security Monitoring, based on the nature of the risk to organizational operations and assets. Part f Product1 Product1 Security, in consultation with Corporate External Legal Affairs (CELA), has defined aset of log events and alerts that meet federal regulatory requirements for incident management and investigation. This structure is intended to support identification of known suspicious activity and to support the investigation of misuse and abuse of Product1 services. To fully comply with applicable regulations, the service teams follow defined requirements for event collection and notification processes. These requirements are contained in the Product1 Security and PilotFish/K-9 onboarding document. Part g Product1 All servers upload logs to a repository service for aggregation and analysis. Reports are generated from this data using NRT Security Monitoring and the automated security alerting tools as described AU-6 and AU-7. These reports are available daily and as needed. For teams using PilotFish, all servers upload logs to a repository service for aggregation and analysis. Reports are generated from this data using PilotFish/K-9 as described AU-6 and AU-7. These reports are available daily and as needed.

Part a Product1 Product2 monitors for unusual traffic patterns using OneDDOS. In addition, service teams monitor for denial of service attacks by monitoring the following key health metrics: CPU usage, network connections, disk input/output operations per second (IOPS), and disk space usage. Product1 service teams also monitor and review web server (e.g. IIS) logs and other application logs (as applicable) for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions. Any unapproved connections detected through auditing or alerting will be triaged using security incident response processes. Part b Product1 See Part (a).

Product1 Product1 Security has defined requirements for active monitoring. Service teams configure active monitoring tools in accordance with these requirements. Active monitoring tools include Near Real Time Security Monitoring (NRT Security Monitoring), System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) and the automated security alerting tools, which are configured to provide real time alerts to Service Team Operations personnel in situations that require immediate action. Service Team Operations personnel act as the designee of the SCA / ISSO. For teams using PilotFish use K-9 which is configured to provide real time alerts to Service Team Operations personnel in situations that require immediate action.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for making provisions so that customer-defined encrypted communications traffic are visible to information system monitoring tools. Product1 This control does not apply to Product1. Product1 does not inspect or monitor customer traffic. By default, Product1 is unaware of what data is outbound from the environment by thecustomer. In the event of customer data spillage, upon customer request, Product1 may assist with the incident including accessing customer data according to the Product1 Incident Response Policies and Procedures.

Customer Responsibility Government customers are responsible for analyzing communications traffic anomalies for customer-deployed resources, including an analysis of outbound communications traffic at the external boundary and at customer-defined interior points within the system to discover anomalies.Product1 Product1 monitors for and protects against mining of system data and customer content. All access to Product1 occurs through remote access to the TSG or Product2 managed Terminal Services Gateways (TSG). The Product1 Security team monitors remote access for any large data exfiltration through the TSGs. Product1 Security uses a robust security monitoring and alerting tool to ingest logs from hosts and other networking infrastructure in the environment, compare these logs to an extensive ruleset, and alert Security personnel when a match is found between the two. Service teams also employ HostIDS to further monitor for data exfiltration at the host level. NRT is used to alert based on specific security events as well as other indicators of compromise such as anomalous behavior and suspicious activity. In addition, access to the Product1 system is limited to a small number of Product1 cleared service team administrators. Product1 cleared service team administrators have taken role-based access training, security awareness training and have been background screened. If Product1 becomes aware of any unlawful access to any customer content stored in its equipment or in its facilities, or unauthorized access to such equipment or facilities resulting in loss, disclosure, or alteration of customer content (each considered a security incident), Product1 will: (a) notify the affected customer of the security incident; (b) investigate the security incident and provide the customer with information about the security incident; and (c) take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the security incident. In the event of customer data spillage, upon customer request, Product1 may assist with the incident including accessing customer data according to the Product1 Incident Response Policies and Procedures.

Customer Responsibility Customers are responsible for monitoring and alerting security personnel of any unusual activities for systems that connect to Product1. Product1 Product1 automated security monitoring and alerting tools generate real time alerts and audit logs from both SCOM and the repository service. These automated tools perform analysis and trigger emails to Service Team Engineering groups when a specified threshold has been reached or event has occurred. Upon receipt, Service Team Engineering personnel use a ticketing tool and create a bug to analyze and track the issue and follow incident response procedures.\")]"
